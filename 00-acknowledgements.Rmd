========================================================================

Thanks to my advisor and mentor Jan Edwards for recognizing my potential,
plucking me from the Masters program, and giving me the opportunity to
be a part of her lab. Jan changed my life by giving me a purpose and
place to develop my skills.

Working in the Learning To Talk lab was an enriching experience. I had
the freedom to explore and experiment, to fail and learn. I entered
as a speech pathologist and left a data scientist. Thanks to Ben Munson,
Mary Beckman, Franzo Law II, Matt Winn, Pat Reidy, Tatiana Thonesavanh,
Alissa Schneeberg, Kayla Kristensen, Allie Johnson, Michelle Erskine,
and Lizzy Hill. Special thanks to Nancy and Bob Wermuth for being role
models. 

A lot of smart and busy people gave me their time and thoughts. Thanks
to the faculty who were always willing to advise me: Margarita
Kaushanskaya, Audra Sterling, Jenny Saffran, Courtney Seidel, Katie
Hustad. Thanks for Susan Ellis Weismer for taking me under her wing and
helping me through some stressful periods. Thanks to Bob McMurray for
giving an enthusiastic, eye-opening lecture at ASHA 2013 about how
eyetracking data works as a measure of word recognition. Thanks to Tim
Rogers for being on my prelim committee.

Thanks to my compatriots at Waisman and elsewhere whom I commiserated
with often: Pierce Edmiston, Courtney Venker, Ron Pomper, Martin
Zettersten, Liz Premo, Janine Mathee, Phoebe Natzke, whoever happened to
be around in Rita's lab on a given day. Thanks to Lolo for telling me
that graduate training for speech pathology is a career for a linguist.

This research would not have been possible without the families and
children who participated in our research. 

I am grateful for the financial support from the NIH grants that
supported me as a trainee or as a research assistant: NICHD
Grant 2-T32-HD049899 to Maryellen MacDonald, NIDCD Grant R01 DC012513 to
Susan Ellis Weismer, Jan Edwards, and Jenny R. Saffran, and NIDCD T32
DC05359-10 to Susan Ellis Weismer. Thanks to departmental administrators
who kept the machine running: Maureen Garity, Amanda Talbert, Choutae
Yang.

I spend all day working in R and RStudio. I want to thank Hadley Wickham
for fixing the language and for working in open source so that I could learn
from his work. Thanks to other RStudio people: Yihui Xie, Kevin Ushey,
Jenny Bryan, and Mara Averick.

I've spent the last two years basically teaching myself Bayesian
statistics. Thanks to the Jonah Gabry, Paul-Christian BÃ¼rkner and the
Stan team for a great ecosystem; David Kaplan for talking me through
some of my early doubts; and Richard McElreath for putting his
*Statistical Rethinking* course on YouTube.

Recognition is due for the community of statisticians, data scientists,
psychologists, and language scientists whom I spent idle moments with on
Twitter. There are too many of you to name. Thanks to the fellow
graduate students, post-docs and others early in their research careers
for helping me feel a sense of community. I often used the medium as a
way to think out loud as I worked through modeling, programming or
plotting problems. Thanks to those who chimed in to answer questions,
suggest references, or offer feedback.

I will finish by thanking the people closest to me. I grew up on dairy farm
in rural Wisconsin and I was the seventh of ten children. That explains
about 70% of who I am and whom I've become. My mom is nothing short of a
superhero. My dad has been a paragon of steadiness and selflessness.
Thanks to my siblings and their families for keeping me from taking
myself too seriously. Thanks also to my-laws for being close to us.

Finally, thanks to my wife Amanda. None of this would have been possible
without your love, support, humor, and nerdery. People sometimes thought
I was a workaholic because I would get to my office at 8 am. But really,
I just wanted to ride the bus with you in the morning. We started a
family together! Shout out to Kiki and Nooper for the snuggles.
