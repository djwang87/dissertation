[*todo*]  LL people, Psych and ILL people

Thanks to my advisor and mentor Jan Edwards for recognizing my potential,
plucking me from the Masters program, and giving me the opportunity to
be a part of her lab. Jan changed my life by giving me a purpose and
place to develop my skills.

Working in the Learning To Talk lab was an enriching experience. I had
the freedom to explore and experiment and to fail and learn. I entered
as a speech pathologist and left a data scientist. Thanks to Ben Munson,
Mary Beckman, Franzo Law II, Matt Winn, Pat Reidy, Tatiana Thonesavanh,
Alissa Schneeberg, Kayla Kristensen, Allie Johnson, Michelle Erskine,
and Lizzy Hill. Special thanks to Nancy and Bob Wermuth for being role
models.

Thanks to my compatriots at Waisman and elsewhere whom I commiserated
with often: Pierce Edmiston, Courtney Venker, Ron Pomper, Martin
Zettersten, Liz Premo, Janine Mathee, Phoebe Natzke, whoever happened to
be around in Rita's lab on a given day.

Thanks to the faculty who were always willing to advise me: Audra
Sterling, Jenny Saffran, Courtney Seidel.

Thanks to the families and children who participated in our research.

Thanks to administrators who kept the machine running: Maureen Garity,
Amanda Talbert, [Waisman's payroll person].

Thanks to Bob McMurray for giving the most consequential lecture I saw
in grad school where he explained how eyetracking data works as a
measure of word recognition.

Susan for taking me under her wing.

I spend all day working in R and RStudio. I want to thank Hadley Wickham
for fixing the language and for working in open source so that I could learn
from his work. Thanks to other RStudio people: Yihui Xie, Kevin Ushey,
Jenny Bryan, and Mara Averick.

I've spent the last two years basically teaching myself Bayesian
statistics. Thanks to the Stan team for a great ecosystem. Thanks to
David Kaplan for talking me through some of my early doubts. Thanks to
Richard McElreath for putting his course on YouTube.

Recognition is due for the community of statistics, data science,
psychology, and language science people that I spent idle moments with
on Twitter. I felt a sense of community with fellow graduate students,
post-docs and others early in their research career:
Dave Kleinschmidt (\@kleinschmidt), Andrew MacDonald (\@polesasunder), 
Molly Lewis (\@mollyllewis), Alexander Etz (\@AlxEtz), 
Melissa Kline (\@melissaekline), Anne Scheel (\@annemscheel), 
Rachael Tatman (\@rctatman), Adrienne Wood (\@adriennerwood),
Brock Ferguson (\@brocferg), Jared Knowles (\@jknowles),
Matti Vuorre (\@vuorre), Jake Westfall (\@CookieSci), 
Mike DeCrescenzo (\@mikedecr), and Shoshana Vasserman (\@shoshievass).
I don't have neat categorization for the rest of you, but I appreciated
learning from you and getting random bits of feedback or advice from
you:
Matt Harris (\@Md_Harris), 
Michael Frank (\@mcxfrank), Karl Broman (\@kwbroman), 
Gavin Simpson (\@ucfagls), Jim Savage (\@jim_savage_), 
Gary Lupyan (\@glupyan), Andrea Panizza (\@unsorsodicorda), 
Erik Westlund (\@erikdbwestlund), Mike Lawrence (\@MikeLwrnc),
and Joseph V. Casillas (\@jvcasill).

Thanks to Lolo for telling me that graduate school for speech pathology is a
good route for a linguist.

I am grateful for the financial support from the NIH grants that
supported me as a trainee or as a research assistant: NICHD
Grant 2-T32-HD049899 to Maryellen MacDonald, NIDCD Grant R01 DC012513 to
Susan Ellis Weismer, Jan Edwards, and Jenny R. Saffran, and NIDCD T32
DC05359-10 to Susan Ellis Weismer.


I grew up on dairy farm in rural Wisconsin where I was the seventh of
ten children. That explains about 70% of who I am and who I've become.
My mom is nothing short of a superhero. My dad has been a paragon of
steadiness and selflessness. Thanks to Jeremy for scolding me for
playing too many videogames when I was in middle school and making me go
*I'm going to prove this jerk wrong by getting a job*. Thanks to Bob for
bailing me out a few times in Madison.

Thanks for my loving and patient wife Amanda. None of this would have
been possible without your support. People sometimes thought I was a workaholic
because I would get to my office at 8 am. But really, I just wanted to
ride the bus with you in the morning. We started a family together! Shout out to Kiki
and Nooper. Thanks to Tom and Nancy for being close to us.
