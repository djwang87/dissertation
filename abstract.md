<p>Vocabulary size in preschool is a robust predictor of later language
development, and early language skills predict early literacy skills at
school entry. By studying the mechanisms that shape word learning, we
can understand how individual differences in language ability arise.
Word recognition—the process of mapping incoming speech sounds to known
or novel words—has been shown in toddlers to predict later language
outcomes. We do not know how this ability develops over time. This
dissertation reports the results for two word-recognition experiments
administered during each year of a 3-year longitudinal study with 160
preschoolers. Ages were 2.5–3 years in year 1 and 4.5–5 years in year 3.</p>
<p>In the first experiment, four images of familiar nouns were presented
onscreen followed by a prompt to view one of the images (e.g., *find the
bell!*). Images included the target word (e.g., *bell*), a semantically
related word (*drum*), a phonologically similar word (*bee*), and an
unrelated word (*swing*). Early differences in word recognition were
longitudinally stable so that children who were faster and more accurate
at age 3 were relatively fast and accurate at age 5. Moreover, word
recognition efficiency at age 3 was a stronger predictor of age-5
vocabulary size than concurrent (age-5) word recognition efficiency.
Word recognition behavior thus provided an important early predictor of
vocabulary growth. Analysis of children’s looks to the competitors
showed that children become more sensitive to the phonological and
semantic competitors, compared to the unrelated word, as they grew
older. Children become better at recognizing familiar words by
developing connections among words.</p>
<p>The second experiment used a mispronunciation study in which a child saw
a familiar object and unfamiliar object and heard a real word (*shoes*),
a one-feature mispronunciation (*suze*), or a nonword (*geeve*).
Contrary to pre-analysis hypotheses, children recognized real words and
fast-selected novel-object referents for nonwords equally well and even
performed better in the nonword condition. Children became more likely
to associate the familiar object with the mispronunciations as they grew
older. At age 5, children showed better retention for novel objects
labeled during with nonwords than with mispronunciations.<p>
