(PART\*) Miscellany {#part-misc .unnumbered}
========================================================================

Scratch paper
========================================================================

This book is made with bookdown, an R package/tool-chain for creating a books in
multiple formats. This chapter is just a placeholder section and some
scratch-paper so that I have some examples on-hand of how to use bookdown's
syntax and features.

***

This is _a book_ written in **Markdown**. You can use anything that
Pandoc's Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

For now, you have to install the development versions of **bookdown** from
Github:


```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("rstudio/bookdown")
```

Code settings:

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::read_chunk("./R/knitr-helpers.R")
```

```{r set-options, tidy = FALSE}
```

Bookdown cheatsheet
------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Cross-references to sections {#manual-section-label-demo}

The headings above were written with the following markdown:

```markdown
## Bookdown cheatsheet

### Cross-references to sections {#manual-section-label-demo}
```

The first one gets an implicit label. The second one has an 
explicit section label.

```markdown
I can refer to Section \@ref(bookdown-cheatsheet) and 
[link to it](#bookdown-cheatsheet) with its implicit label.

I can refer to Section \@ref(manual-section-label-demo) and 
[link to it](#manual-section-label-demo) with its explicit label.
```

I can refer to Section \@ref(bookdown-cheatsheet) and 
[link to it](#bookdown-cheatsheet) with its implicit label.

I can refer to Section \@ref(manual-section-label-demo) and 
[link to it](#manual-section-label-demo) with its explicit label.

### Cross-references to appendices

The sample principles apply to appendices.

```markdown
This is a reference to [an appendix](#mp-experiment-items)

The number of that appendix \@ref(mp-experiment-items). I hope.

Both: See [Appendix \@ref(mp-experiment-items)](#mp-experiment-items)
```

### Cross-references to tables

````markdown
The chunk label `table-single` provides an implicit label 
for Table \@ref(tab:table-single).

`r ''````{r table-single, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(
  head(mtcars[, 1:5], 5), booktabs = TRUE,
  caption = 'A table of the first 5 rows of the mtcars data.'
)
```

  caption = 'A table of the first 5 rows of the mtcars data.'
)
```

### Figure references and using text references as captions

````markdown
The caption for Figure \@ref(fig:cat) is defined as a _text reference_
below and passed to the `fig.cap` chunk option.

(ref:cat-cap) This is a happy cat.

`r ''````{r cat, fig.cap = "(ref:cat-cap)", out.width = "30%", fig.show = "hold"}
knitr::include_graphics(
  rep("./misc/happy-cat-grooming-itself-vector-file.png", 2)
)
```
````

<!-- I actually can't use that same text-reference label here because  -->
<!-- then that text will be injected into the code block above, so I -->
<!-- add `happy-` to the labels. -->

```{r, echo = FALSE}
happy_cat_ref <- ifelse(is_word_output(), "happy-cat-docx", "happy-cat")
```


The caption for Figure \@ref(fig:`r happy_cat_ref`) is defined as a _text reference_
below and passed to the `fig.cap` chunk option.

(ref:happy-cat-cap) This is a happy cat.


```{r happy-cat, fig.cap = "(ref:happy-cat-cap)", echo = !is_word_output(), eval = !is_word_output(), out.width = "30%", fig.show = "hold"}
knitr::include_graphics(
  rep("./misc/happy-cat-grooming-itself-vector-file.png", 2)
)
```

```{r happy-cat-docx, fig.cap = "(ref:happy-cat-cap)", eval = is_word_output(), echo = is_word_output(), fig.width = 3}
knitr::include_graphics("./misc/happy-cat-grooming-itself-vector-file.png")
```
