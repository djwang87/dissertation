Research Hypotheses
===================

In this section, I outline the main hypotheses I plan to study for each
specific aim. This section is intended to preregister the main analyses
for this project, so I can cleanly separate confirmatory and exploratory
results.

Specific Aim 1 (Familiar Word Recognition and Lexical Competition)
------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Children’s accuracy and efficiency of recognizing words will improve
    each year.

-   There are stable individual differences in lexical processing of
    familiar words such that children who are relatively fast at Year 1
    remain relatively fast at Year 2 and Year 3.

-   However, the magnitude of these individual differences diminishes
    over time, as children converge on a mature level of performance for
    this paradigm.

-   As a consequence, individual differences in word recognition at age\ 3, 
    for example, will be more discriminating and predictive of age 5
    language outcomes than differences at age 4.

-   Vocabulary size and lexical processing will be tightly correlated
    such that large year-over-year gains in one measure will predict
    large year-over-years gains in the other measure.

-   Children will become more sensitive to lexical competitors as they
    age, based on the hypothesis that children discover similarities
    among words as a consequence of learning more and more words.

-   Children will differ in their sensitivity to lexical competitors,
    and these individual differences will correlate with other
    child-level measures.


Specific Aim 2 (Referent Selection and Mispronunciations)
---------------------------------------------------------

-   Children’s accuracy and efficiency of recognizing real words and
    fast-associating nonwords will improve each year.

-   Performance in real word recognition and fast association of
    nonwords will be highly correlated, based on the hypothesis that the
    same process (referent selection) operates in both situations.

-   Under the alternative hypothesis, real word recognition and fast
    referent selection reflect different skills with different
    developmental trajectories. Thus, if there is any dissociation
    between recognition of real words and nonwords, it will be observed
    in younger children.

-   Although these two measures will be correlated, I predict
    performance in the nonword condition will be a better predict of
    future vocabulary growth than performance in the real word
    condition. This hypothesis is based on the idea that fast referent
    selection is a more relevant skill for learning new words than
    recognition of known words.

-   For the mispronunciations, I predict children with larger
    vocabularies (that is, older children) will be more likely to
    tolerate a mispronunciation as a production of familiar word
    compared to children with smaller vocabularies.

-   Mispronunciations that feature later-mastered sounds (e.g.,
    *rice*/*wice*) will be more likely to be associated to novel objects
    than earlier-mastered sounds (*duck*/*guck*).


Specific Aim 3 (Computational Modeling)
---------------------------------------

The research questions for this aim are more exploratory than
confirmatory. I plan to use the well-studied TRACE model of spoken word
recognition [@TRACE]. The TRACE model has no built-in
semantic representations, so it will be used to model data from the
two-image mispronunciation experiment (Aim 2) and a “semantic-less”
subset of the data from the four-image experiment (Aim 1). Research
questions include:

-   What parameterizations of the TRACE model of word recognition
    account Year 1 word recognition data?

-   If the default model of TRACE represents “default” adult listeners,
    how the children are Year 1 different than adults.

-   How do these parameterizations have to change year over year to
    accommodate the data from older children at Year 2 and again at Year
    3? What is the developmental story for these changing
    parameterizations?

-   How does the model handle mispronunciations? What changes are
    required to accommodate mispronunciations and novel words? @TRACE_Mispro 
    have simulated mispronunciation experiments like
    @WhiteMorgan2008, although it is not clear how the model can
    accommodate the current mispronunciation experiment which presents
    mispronunciations and nonwords.

-   How does the model’s vocabulary parameters (namely the size and
    composition of the lexicon used for the simulations) correlate with
    the vocabulary size of participants?

-   Can the model simulations incorporate other child-level measures?
    For example, do children who demonstrate poorer speech perception in
    a non-eyetracking speech discrimination task require lower levels of
    phoneme inhibition in their word recognition models?
