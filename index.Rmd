  [*draft*] Vocabulary size in preschool is a robust predictor of later language
  development, and early language skills predict early literacy skills at
  school entry. By studying the mechanisms that shape word
  learning, we can understand how individual differences in language
  ability arise and identify strategies for closing language gaps between
  children. Word recognition—the process of mapping incoming speech sounds
  to known or novel words—has been shown in toddlers to predict later language
  outcomes. We do not know how this ability develops over time, and we do
  not know when word recognition is most predictive of future outcomes.
  This dissertation reports the results for two word-recognition
  experiments administered during each year of a 3-year longitudinal study
  with 160 preschoolers. Ages were 2.5–3 years in year 1 and 4.5–5 years
  in year 3.
  
  In the first experiment, four images of familiar nouns were presented
  onscreen followed by a prompt to view one of the images (e.g., *find the
  bell!*). Images included the target word (e.g., *bell*), a semantically
  related word (*drum*), a phonologically similar word (*bee*), and an
  unrelated word (*swing*). Early differences in word recognition were
  longitudinally stable so that children who were faster and more accurate
  at age 3 were relatively fast and accurate at age 5. Moreover, word
  recognition efficiency at age 3 was a stronger predictor of age-5
  vocabulary size than concurrent (age-5) word recognition efficiency.
  These results confirm that word recognition behavior provides an
  important early predictor of vocabulary growth. Analysis of children's
  looks to the competitors showed that children become more sensitive to
  the phonological and semantic foils, compared to the unrelated word, as
  they grew older. Children become better at recognizing familiar words by
  developing connections among words.
  
  The second experiment used a mispronunciation study in which a child saw
  a familiar object and unfamiliar object and heard either a real word
  (*shoes*), a one-feature mispronunciation of the word (*suze*), or a
  nonword (*geeve*). Contrary to pre-analysis hypotheses, children
  recognized the real words and fast-selected novel-objects referents for
  the nonwords equally well, and in fact, performed better in the nonword
  condition. Children also became to associate the familiar object with
  the mispronunciations as they grew older. At age 5, children's retention
  of the unfamiliar objects paired with the nonwords and mispronunciations
  was tested offline, and children showed better retention for the
  nonwords than mispronunciations.
