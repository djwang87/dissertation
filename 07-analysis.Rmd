# Analysis

## Growth Curve Analysis

For each experimental task, I will study how word recognition changes
over time by modeling how growth curves change over developmental time.
This amounts to study how the growth curve parameters changes year over
year in the study. I can model the data for an eyetracking task by
including dummy-coded indicators for Year 1, Year 2, and Year 3 and
having these indicators interact with the growth curve parameters. In
such a model, Year 2 would be the reference year, so the Year 1
parameters would estimate how the word-recognition-curves change from
Year 2 to Year 1, and Year 3 parameters would be interpreted similarly.

`r insert_html_math()`
\begin{align*}
   \text{Year 2 Growth Curve:}\\ 
   \text{log-odds}(\mathit{looking}) &= β_0 + β_1 * \textit{Time}^1 + β_2 * \textit{Time}^2 + β_3 * \textit{Time}^3 \\
   \text{Adjustments to Year 2:} \\
  β_i &= γ_{i:2} + γ_{i:1} * \text{Year1}  + γ_{i:3} * \text{Year3}  \\
\end{align*}
`r insert_html_math()`

Thus, the interaction effects for the intercept term ($γ_{0:1}$,
$γ_{0:3}$) describe how overall accuracy changed between years, and
interaction effects for the linear-time terms ($γ_{1:1}$, $γ_{1:3}$)
describe changes in overall processing efficiency between years.


Aim 1 (Familiar Word Recognition and Lexical Competition)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I predict that children will be more sensitive to the phonological foil
and semantic foils in this task as they age and learn more words. This
hypothesis is based on the idea that children discover similarities
among words as they learn word and integrate them into their lexicon. To
test this hypothesis, I will study how the probability of fixating on
the foils changes over trial-time and how these growth curves change
from year to year. In the conventional model of eyetracking data, the
outcome is a binomial choice—Target versus Distractor—and we can
estimate the log-odds of fixating on the target image relative to the
distractors. To study the specific effect of the Phonological foil in
this task, @RWLPaper treated the Unrelated foil as a reference
distractor and compared two separate binomial growth curves (see Figure
\@ref(fig:rwl-comp-to-unre)): Target versus Phonological, and Target
versus Unrelated. The same technique was used on the Semantic foil as
well. With this approach, shown below, we observed an early negative
effect of the phonological foil and a late negative effect of the
semantic foil.

(ref:rwl-comp-to-unre-cap) Reprint of Figure 4 from @RWLPaper to
illustrate the strategy of examining lexical competition effects where
the semantic foil and phonological foil are compared to the unrelated
image.

```{r rwl-comp-to-unre, fig.cap = "(ref:rwl-comp-to-unre-cap)", echo = FALSE, out.width="100%"}

```

I plan to employ this technique for studying lexical competition effects
and their development from Year\ 1 to Year\ 2 to Year\ 3.[^4] Increased
lexical completion would be reflected in greater interference from the
foils compared to the unrelated image.


A more comprehensive statistical model for this experiment would capture
the fact that the data are multinomial: Target versus Phonological
versus Semantic versus Unrelated. However, multinomial mixed effects
growth curves have not been used for eyetracking data. They are not
estimable with the standard classical modeling software (lme4). I plan
to examine whether such a model is feasible with Bayesian techniques,
but it may prove to be too unstable. In that case, I will fall back to
the above described strategy.


Aim 2 (Referent Selection and Mispronunciations)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

For this task, I will model how the looks to the familiar image differ
in each condition (real words, mispronunciations, nonwords) and how the
growth curves for each condition change year over year. This model will
use growth curve model described in [Growth Curve Analysis](#growth-curve-analysis) but
augmented with Condition effects.

I will examine whether and when any dissociation is observed for word
recognition in the real word and nonword conditions. @McMurray2012 argue that 
familiar word recognition and fast
association for novel words reflect the same cognitive process: referent
selection. Data from this task would support with this hypothesis when
the growth curves for looks to the familiar image are symmetrical for
the real word and nonword conditions. Figure \@ref(fig:le-means), showing data
from @MPPaper [, _n_\ =\ 34 children, 30-46 months old], shows some
symmetry for the real word and nonword conditions.

(ref:le-means-cap) Condition averages for data described by @MPPaper. Compare to
Figure 2 in the original manuscript.

```{r le-means, fig.cap = "(ref:le-means-cap)", echo = FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./misc/le_means.png")
```


I will test whether the two measures ever dissociate by computing the
posterior predicted difference between the growth curves. This approach
is similar to the bootstrap-based divergence analyses used in some word
recognition experiments [e.g., @Oleson2015; @eyetrackingR]. The
essential question is when—at which specific time points—do two growth
curves differ significantly from one another. The bootstrap approach
uses resampling to get an estimate, whereas I will use posterior
predicted samples to estimate these differences. (I have not seen my
approach used yet in the literature, so it is a small innovation.)

Specifically, I will compute the posterior-predicted looks to the
familiar object in the real word condition, P(Familiar | Real Word, Time
*t*, Child *i*) and the analogous looks to the unfamiliar object in the
nonword condition, P(Unfamiliar | Nonword, Time *t*, Child *i*). The
difference between these two probabilities estimates how the time course
of word recognition differs between these two conditions, and I can use
50% and 90% uncertainty intervals to determine during which time points
the curves credibly differ from each other. Figure
\@ref(fig:le-post-diff) shows this calculation performed on data from
@MPPaper. If feasible, I will also examine whether these measures
dissociate *within* children and examine which child-level factors are
associated with these kinds of listeners.

(ref:le-post-diff-cap) Demonstration of posterior difference technique on data from @MPPaper.

```{r le-post-diff, fig.cap = "(ref:le-post-diff-cap)", echo = FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./misc/mp_post_diff.png")
```

Even though performance on the real word and nonword conditions might be
highly correlated, one might intuitively hypothesize that that
performance on the nonword condition to be a better predictor of
concurrent or future vocabulary size. The rationale would be that
referent selection for novel words is a more transparent test of the
word learner’s basic task of associating new labels with objects.
Therefore, I will examine how each of these measures relates to
vocabulary growth.

I will describe how looking behavior in the mispronunciation condition
changes over time and changes for specific mispronunciation patterns.
Overall, I predict that children will be more tolerant of
mispronunciations as they age, because older children know more words
and have more implicit knowledge about the similarities among words. As
for specific mispronunciation items, let us (safely) suppose that speech
perception improves with age, especially for later mastered sounds. Then
we should expect that looking patterns for the *rice*-*wice* trials
change significantly between Year 2 and Year 3, at least compared to
looking patterns on trials with mispronunciations of earlier acquired
sounds (e.g., *girl*-*dirl* or *duck*-*guck*). Therefore, I will examine
individual mispronunciation effects and how they are associated with
child-level measures, including speech perception.
