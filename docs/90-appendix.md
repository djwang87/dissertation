replaced with rice/wice.

Items used in the visual world experiment {#vw-experiment-items}
=========================================

Each row of the table represents a set of four images used in a trial
for the experiment. There were two blocks of trials with different
images and trial orderings. For the two unrelated foils with more than
one word listed, the first word was used in block one and the second in
block 2.

Related Work {#related-work}
========================

In this section, I clarify relationships between this project and other
word recognition research reported from our lab. In short, our lab has
reported results about the two-image and four-image experiments from
cross-sectional samples, describing child-level measures that predict
performance in these tasks. In contrast, my dissertation 1) focuses on
the longitudinal development of word recognition and 2) engages with the
fine-grained details of lexical processing.

@MPPaper analyzed a different version of the
mispronunciation experiment on a different sample of children (*n*\ =\ 34,
30-46 months old). This earlier version included both real word and the
mispronunciation of the real word in the same block of trial. For
example, a child would hear “dog” and “tog” during the same session of
the experiment. This design might subtly temper the effect of
mispronounced stimuli by allowing the listener to compare the
mispronunciation to its correctly produced counterpart. The version of
the experiment in Specific Aim 2 separates the real words and
mispronunciations so that a child never hears a familiar word and its
mispronunciation during the same block of trials. With this design,
there is no explicit point of comparison for the mispronunciation, and
the child has to rely on his or her own lexical representations when
processing these words.

@RWLPaper analyzed data from the
four-image experiment in Specific Aim 1. This study featured a diverse
cross-sectional sample of 60 children, half of whom received the
experiment in African American English and half received it in
Mainstream American English. The sample ranged in age from 28 to 60
months. The study “borrowed” data from 23 participants from Year 1 of
the longitudinal study to enrich parts of the samples demographics. For
this manuscript, we analyzed how vocabulary and maternal education
predicted looking patterns, including relative looks to the semantic and
phonological foils.

Mahr and Edwards (under review) was the manuscript I originally authored
for my preliminary examinations. The paper analyzes the same kinds of relations
as @Weisleder2013 which showed that lexical processing efficiency
mediated the effect of language input on future vocabulary size. In particular, I
asked whether word recognition performance on the four-image task of Specific
Aim 1, vocabulary size, and home language input data from Year 1 predicted
vocabulary size at Year 2. The paper only examined looks to the familiar
image from one year of the study, so it did not analyze any lexical
competition effects or the development of word recognition within
children.
