=======================================================================

This experiment tested how children responded to familiar words,
one-feature mispronunciations of those familiar words, and unambiguous
novel words. These three types of stimuli allow us to examine features
of children's representations of familiar words and their processing of
unfamiliar words.


A lexical processing account of the results
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Children were sensitive to mispronunciations of familiar words. In terms
of lexical processing, the mispronounced syllable onset leads a child
down a phonological garden path. The "d" in *dirl* activates a
neighborhood a d-inital words. The rest of the syllable, however,
provides information needed to activate *girl*. Children therefore are
slower to build up activation of the word because of the onset-mismatch,
and they show less activation overall because the spoken word only
matches the rime of the word. Put differently, they get a late start and
have to work with a poor-fitting form of the word. The finding that
children are better at processing mispronunciations at age 5 suggests
that older children are better able to build up more activation to these
candidate rime words.

Children also processed mispronunciations differently based on the image
they were fixated on. One complication with a simple lexical processing
interpretation is that this is a two-image task. Children have ample
time to view each image before the noun onset and build up an
expectations about the words they might hear named. This possibility
leads me to speculate that children might be more uncertain in the
trials where they hear "shoup" while fixated on *soup* because they
build up the activation of *soup*. This prepotent activation would make
the mismatch from the mispronunciation more severe leading to greater
uncertainty. This explanation, however, implies some kind of inhibition
where *soup* suppresses the activation of "sh"-initial words. The
results from Specific Aim 1, which do not provide any evidence for changes
in lexical inhibition, make me skeptical of this explanation. Thus, the
effect of children's fixation location on their immediate response to
speech provides an avenue for further research in this area.


A nonword is just a word you haven't learned yet
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

I hypothesized that the nonword condition might be more difficult than
the real word condition, particularly for younger children as seen in
@Bion2013. This prediction did not bear out at all, and indeed, there
was an advantage
in the nonword condition in later ages. Part of this advantage may be a
novelty bias. @TRACE_Mispro used the TRACE model of word recognition
[@TRACE] to simulate these kinds of situations. In one set of
simulations, the novel object recieves a novelty/salience boost to
resting activation. During presentation of the nonword, none of the
child's known words build up enough activation to overtake the novel
word. In another set of simulations, the novel word is added as to the
lexicon as a low-frequency word, and the absense of competition of any
familiar words causes the novel word to win out. In both of these
accounts, children can quickly associate the novel object with a nonword
because there are no familiar words to interfere with the process.

The data probably supports both processing accounts. During data
reduction, I separated trials based on initial-fixation location because
children become increasingly likely to start nonword trials on the novel
object. This bias affected 50% of nonword trials at age 3, 55% at age 4,
and 59% at age 5. There is a novelty preference that for these trials
that gets stronger with development. Children are also developing
inchoate lexical representations of these nonwords, consistent with
low-frequency lexical item simulations. Children were on average were
able to recall the unfamiliar image paired with 5/6 nonwords.


The findings of @Swingley2007 can help us understand the mispronunciation retention results.
In that study, toddlers were better
able to retain unneighbored nonwords (like *shang* or *meb*) compared to
neighbored nonwords (mispronunciations like *tog* [*dog*] or *gall*
[*ball*]). They concluded that part of the fast-referent selection involves a
probability calculation in which children "evaluat[e] the likelihood that an
utterance conveys a new word". 





@TRACE_Mispro simulated the nonword processing with TRACE in order to 




-nonwords and real words

no dissociation.

-why the nonword advantage

novelty, plus penalized performance

Why do children prefer nonwords over familiar words? The most obvious answer would be a novelty effect. Another reason would be that these are unambiguous words. Because of the mispronunciation trials, a child hears familiar words or bad versions of familiar words. It could be that cost of processing or recovering from mispronunciations makes children more cautious or less certain for familiar words. Whereas for the nonwords, there is no ambiguity.

<!-- Not sure where I am going here... It's not just the word forms alone but the child's expectations I guess and those expectations might change or become more efficient with age. This is not as big of a concern for the four-image task because the child hears well-formed words. -->

Limitations and implications
------------------------------------------------------------------------






Limitations. The biggest limitation to this study is that it applied a procedure designed for toddlers on preschoolers. That is to say, it was too easy for there to be large year-over-year developmental changes in their performance. Children were successful at recognizing real words and fast-selecting referents for nonwords at age 3 and improved a litt
