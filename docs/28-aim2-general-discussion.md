This experiment tested how children responded to familiar words, one-feature mispronunciations of those familiar words, and unambiguous novel words. These three types of stimuli allow us to examine features of children's representations of familiar words.


A lexical processing account of the findings
------------------------------------------------------------------------

In terms of lexical processing, the mispronounced syllable onset leads
them down a phonological garden path. The "d" in *dirl* activates a
neighborhood a d-inital words. The rest of the syllable, however,
provides information needed to activate "girl". Figure XX illustrates
these differences. Children therefore are slower to build up activation
of the word because the onset-mismatch, and they show less activation
overall because the word only matches the rime of the word. They get a
late start and have to work with a poor-fitting form of the word. The
finding that children are better at processing mispronunciations at
age 5 suggests that children are able to build up more activation to
these candidate rime words. 

One complication with the lexical processing interpretation is that this is a two-image task. Children have ample time to view each image before the noun onset. In viewing the images, children can build up an expectations for the words they will hear named. This expectation can build up the resting activation of the word "girl" before it is labeled as "dirl". Thus, the lexical processing interpretation is not as simple as a child building up information from the rest of the word and matching "dirl" to the photo of the girl. 


Limitations and implications
------------------------------------------------------------------------






Limitations. The biggest limitation to this study is that it applied a procedure designed for toddlers on preschoolers. That is to say, it was too easy for there to be large year-over-year developmental changes in their performance. Children were successful at recognizing real words and fast-selecting referents for nonwords at age 3 and improved a litt


Why do children prefer nonwords over familiar words? The most obvious answer would be a novelty effect. Another reason would be that these are unambiguous words. Because of the mispronunciation trials, a child hears familiar words or bad versions of familiar words. It could be that cost of processing or recovering from mispronunciations makes children more cautious or less certain for familiar words. Granted, this is speculation. Whereas for the nonwords, there is no ambiguity.
