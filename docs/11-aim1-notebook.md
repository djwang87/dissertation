_Notebook status: Code is hidden. Now, the results and figures can be fleshed
out and finalized._







## Raw data visualization

First, let's plot the overall averages from each year.

The raw data plainly confirm hypothesis 1:

> Childrenâ€™s accuracy and efficiency of recognizing words will improve each year.

We can also plot a spaghetti plot to invidual lines for each participant. We see
that they tighten from year to year.

## Data screening



After mapping the gaze coordinates onto the onscreen images, we performed data
screening. We considered the time window from 0 to
2000 ms after target noun onset. We identified a trial
as _unreliable_ if at least 50% of the looks
were missing during the time window. We excluded an entire block of trials if it
had fewer than 12 reliable trials. 



Table \@ref(tab:screening-counts) shows the numbers of participants and trials
excluded at each time point due to unreliable data.

Plot the data after partial data screening. We include the curves from the
earlier plots in gray. The data-cleaning process slightly increases the average
accuracy during the plateau-ed portion of the growth curve.

### Add a note about the bad version of the experiment

(_Skip for now._)

### Special case data screening

(_Skip for now._ This is where I review the participant notes and will remove 
children who have to be excluded for other reasons, like being diagnosed with a 
language disorder at TimePoint 3.)





### Interim summary

* Visual evidence that group averages get faster and more reliable at looking 
  to target each year. 
  
  
## Prepare the dataset for modeling

## Data preparation

Above we cleaned the data to remove trials with excessive missing data 
and blocks of trials with too few trials. Now we prepare the data for modelling.


```
#> $bin_width
#> [1] 3
#> 
#> $start_time
#> [1] 250
#> 
#> $end_time
#> [1] 1500
#> 
#> $bin_length
#> [1] 50
```

We downsampled the data into 50-ms
(3-frame) bins in order to smooth the data. We modeled
the looks from 250 to 1500 ms. Lastly, 
we aggregated looks by child, study and
time, and created orthogonal polynomials to use as time features for the model



Plot the model-ready data. For this plot, we use the so-called _empirical logit_
transformation because the regular logit (log-odds) generates too extreme of
values for plotting. 

<img src="11-aim1-notebook_files/figure-html/spaghetti-elogit-1.png" width="100%" />

Those extreme lines indicate sparse data where there are zero-to-few looks to
the distractors compared to the target. These are the 20 most extreme bins, to 
illustrate how empirical logit tames infinite values.
