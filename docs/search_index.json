By studying the mechanisms that shape word learning, we can understand how individual differences in language ability arise and identify strategies for closing language gaps between children. Word recognition—the process of mapping incoming speech sounds to known or novel words—has been shown in toddlers to predict later language outcomes. We do not know how this ability develops over time, and we do not know when word recognition is most predictive of future outcomes. This dissertation reports the results for two word-recognition experiments administered during each year of a 3-year longitudinal study with 160 preschoolers. Ages were 2.5–3 years in year 1 and 4.5–5 years in year 3. In the first experiment, four images of familiar nouns were presented onscreen followed by a prompt to view one of the images (e.g., find the bell!). Images included the target word (e.g., bell), a semantically related word (drum), a phonologically similar word (bee), and an unrelated word (swing). Early differences in word recognition were longitudinally stable so that children who were faster and more accurate at age 3 were relatively fast and accurate at age 5. Moreover, word recognition efficiency at age 3 was a stronger predictor of age-5 vocabulary size than concurrent (age-5) word recognition efficiency. These results confirm that word recognition behavior provides an important early predictor of vocabulary growth. Analysis of children’s looks to the competitors showed that children become more sensitive to the phonological and semantic foils, compared to the unrelated word, as they grew older. Children become better at recognizing familiar words by developing connections among words. The second experiment used a mispronunciation study in which a child saw a familiar object and unfamiliar object and heard either a real word (shoes), a one-feature mispronunciation of the word (suze), or a nonword (geeve). Contrary to pre-analysis hypotheses, children recognized the real words and fast-selected novel-objects referents for the nonwords equally well, and in fact, performed better in the nonword condition. Children also became to associate the familiar object with the mispronunciations as they grew older. At age 5, children’s retention of the unfamiliar objects paired with the nonwords and mispronuncitions was tested offline, and children showed better retention for the nonwords than mispronunciations.

["specific-aims.html", "Chapter 1 Specific aims 1.1 Specific Aim 1 (Familiar Word Recognition and Lexical Competition) 1.2 Specific Aim 2 (Referent Selection and Mispronunciations) 1.3 Summary", " Chapter 1 Specific aims Individual differences in language ability are apparent as soon as children start talking, but it is difficult to identify children at risk for language delay or disorder. Recent work suggests word recognition efficiency—that is, how well children map incoming speech to words—may help identify early differences in children’s language trajectories. Children learn spoken language by listening to caregivers, so children who are faster at recognizing words have an advantage for word learning. This view is borne out by some studies suggesting that children who are faster at processing words show greater vocabulary gains months later (e.g., Weisleder &amp; Fernald, 2013). We do not know, however, how word recognition itself develops over time within a child. This is an important open question because word recognition may provide a key mechanism for understanding how individual differences emerge in word learning and persist into early language development. Without a developmental account of word recognition, we lack the context for understanding individual differences in lexical processing. Thus, even the big-picture questions are unclear: Do early differences persist over time so that faster processors remain relatively fast later in childhood? Or, is such a question ill-posed because the magnitude of the differences among children shrink with age? I plan to address this gap in knowledge by analyzing three years of word recognition data collected in a recently completed longitudinal study of 180 children. In particular, I will examine the development of familiar word recognition, lexical competition, and fast referent selection (the ability to map novel words to novel objects in the moment). Through these analyses, I will develop a fine-grained description of how the dynamics of word recognition change year over year, and I will study how differences in word recognition performance relate to other child-level measures (such as vocabulary and speech perception). 1.1 Specific Aim 1 (Familiar Word Recognition and Lexical Competition) To characterize the development of familiar word recognition and lexical competition, I will analyze data from a visual world paradigm experiment, conducted at age 3, age 4, and age 5. In these eyetracking experiments, children were presented with four images of familiar objects and heard a prompt to view one of the images. The four images included a target word (e.g., bell), a semantically related word (drum), a phonologically similar word (bee), and an unrelated word (swing). I will use a series of growth curve analyses to describe how children’s familiar word recognition develops year over year. Of interest is how individual differences at age 3 persist into age 5. I will also examine the children’s looks to the distractors to study the developmental course of lexical competition from similar sounding and similar meaning words. Changes in sensitivity to competing words can reveal how lexical competition emerges as a byproduct of learning new words. 1.2 Specific Aim 2 (Referent Selection and Mispronunciations) To characterize how fast referent selection develops longitudinally, I will analyze data from a looking-while-listening mispronunciation experiment, conducted at age 3, age 4, and age 5. In these eyetracking experiments (Law &amp; Edwards, 2015; based on White &amp; Morgan, 2008), children saw an image of a familiar object and an unfamiliar object, and they heard either a correct production of the familiar object (e.g., soup), a one-feature mispronunciation of the familiar object (shoop), or a novel word unrelated to either image (cheem). The correct productions test familiar word recognition and the nonwords test fast referent selection. The mispronunciations test the child’s phonological categories by showing whether the child permits, rejects, or equivocates about mispronunciations. I will use growth curve analyses to study how children’s responses to the three word types change over time. I will examine familiar word recognition and fast referent selection to determine which feature of lexical processing better predicts vocabulary growth. I plan to examine dissociations or asymmetries in these forms of processing within children as a way to empirically assess the claim that “novel word processing (referent selection) is not distinct from familiar word recognition” (McMurray, Horst, &amp; Samuelson, 2012). Finally, I will examine how individual differences in vocabulary and speech perception predict responses to mispronunciations and novel words. 1.3 Summary This project investigates how word recognition develops during the preschool years. There has been no published research studying word recognition longitudinally after age two. Findings will show how individual differences in lexical processing change over time and can reveal how low-level mechanisms underlying word recognition mature longitudinally in children. These findings will have translational value by studying processing abilities that subserve word learning and by assessing the predictive relationships between early word recognition ability and later language outcomes.

["research-hypotheses.html", "Chapter 2 Research hypotheses 2.1 Specific Aim 1 (Familiar Word Recognition and Lexical Competition) 2.2 Specific Aim 2 (Referent Selection and Mispronunciations)", " Chapter 2 Research hypotheses In this section, I outline the main hypotheses I plan to study for each specific aim. This section is intended to preregister the main analyses for this project. 2.1 Specific Aim 1 (Familiar Word Recognition and Lexical Competition) Children’s accuracy and efficiency of recognizing words will improve each year. There are stable individual differences in lexical processing of familiar words such that children who are relatively fast at age 3 remain relatively fast at age 4 and age 5. However, the magnitude of these individual differences diminishes over time, as children converge on a mature level of performance for this paradigm. Consequently, individual differences in word recognition at age 3, for example, will be more discriminating and predictive of age 5 language outcomes than differences at age 4 or age 5. Children will become more sensitive to lexical competitors as they age, based on the hypothesis that children discover similarities among words as a consequence of learning more and more words. Children will differ in their sensitivity to lexical competitors, and these individual differences will correlate with other child-level measures. 2.2 Specific Aim 2 (Referent Selection and Mispronunciations) Children’s accuracy and efficiency of recognizing real words and fast-associating nonwords will improve each year. Performance in real word recognition and fast association of nonwords will be highly correlated, based on the hypothesis that the same process (referent selection) operates in both situations. Under the alternative hypothesis, real word recognition and fast referent selection reflect different skills with different developmental trajectories. Thus, if there is any dissociation between recognition of real words and nonwords, it will be observed in younger children. Although these two measures will be correlated, I predict performance in the nonword condition will be a better predict of future vocabulary growth than performance in the real word condition. This hypothesis is based on the idea that fast referent selection is a more relevant skill for learning new words than recognition of known words. For the mispronunciations, I predict children with larger vocabularies (that is, older children) will be more likely to tolerate a mispronunciation as a production of familiar word compared to children with smaller vocabularies. Mispronunciations that feature later-mastered sounds (e.g., rice/wice) will be more likely to be associated to novel objects than earlier-mastered sounds (duck/guck). "],
["aim1-introduction.html", "Chapter 3 Familiar word recognition 3.1 Lexical processing dynamics 3.2 Individual differences in word recognition 3.3 The current study", " Chapter 3 Familiar word recognition 3.1 Lexical processing dynamics Mature listeners recognize spoken words by continuously evaluating incoming speech for possible word matches. The first part of a word activates multiple candidate words in parallel. These candidates compete as more of the speech signal enters the system, and the best-fitting word is the favored interpretation. For example, the onset “bee” might activate phonologically compatible candidates like bee, beam, beetle, beak, beaker, beginning, and so on, but an additional “m” would narrow the candidates to just beam. Semantic relationships also influence lexical processing, and cascading phonological-semantic effects—for instance, where castle activates the phonologically similar candy which in turn activates the semantically related sweet—have been demonstrated (Marslen-Wilson &amp; Zwitserlood, 1989). Both low-level phonetic cues and high-level grammatical, semantic and pragmatic information can influence this process, but this continuous processing of multiple competing candidates is the essential dynamic underlying word recognition in adults (Magnuson, Mirman, &amp; Myers, 2013). What about young children who know considerably fewer words? Eyetracking studies with toddlers have suggested a developmental continuity between toddlers and adult listeners. Children recognize words incrementally (Swingley, Pinto, &amp; Fernald, 1999), match truncated words to their intended referents (Fernald, Swingley, &amp; Pinto, 2001), and use information from neighboring words in a sentence to facilitate word recognition. This information can be high-level grammatical or semantic cues. Lew-Williams and Fernald (2007) found that Spanish-acquiring preschoolers can use grammatical gender on determiners (el or la) to anticipate the word named in a two-object word recognition task. Borovsky, Elman, and Fernald (2012) showed that children can use semantic information from an agent and a verb (e.g., the dog chased) to anticipate a plausible noun (the cat). The information can also be low-level phonetic variation: We found that toddlers look earlier to a named image when the coarticulatory formant cues on word the predicted the noun of the sentence, compared to tokens with neutral coarticulation (Mahr, McMillan, Saffran, Ellis Weismer, &amp; Edwards, 2015). There is some evidence for lexical competition where children are sensitive to phonological and semantic similarities among words. Ellis Weismer, Haebig, Edwards, Saffran, and Venker (2016) showed that toddlers (14–29 months old) look less reliably to a named image when the onscreen competitor was a semantically related word or perceptually similar image. Huang and Snedeker (2011) presented evidence of cascading semantic-phonological activation in five-year-olds such that for a target word like log, the children looked more to an indirect phonological competitor like key (competing through its activation of lock) than they looked to an unrelated image like carrot. Priming studies also reveal that children are sensitive to phonological similarities among words. Mani and Plunkett (2010) demonstrated cross-modal phonological priming effects in 18-month-olds. In this study, a picture of prime word (e.g., cat or teeth) was presented in silence; then two images (cup and shoe) were presented, one of which was named (cup). Children on average looked more to the target word (cup) when it was primed by an image of a phonological neighbor (cat), and the children performed at chance when the prime was not related to the named word. Mani, Durrant, and Floccia (2012) found a similar result for cascading phonological-semantic priming with 24-month-olds: Children looked more to a target (e.g., shoe) compared to a distractor (door) when primed by an image (clock, assumed to activate sock which primed shoe).1 Altvater-Mackensen and Mani (2013) demonstrated phonological-semantic priming even when the prime is a mispronunciations. German-learning two-year-olds heard a prime word, and 200 ms later two images appear on screen (a cow, Kuh and a fork, Gabel), one of which was labeled (“Kuh”).The prime word was a semantically related word (“Schaf”, sheep), an onset-mispronunciation of the related word (“Faf” or “Taf”), or an unrelated prime (“Buch”, book). Children looked to the target about equally well in the two prime conditions: approximately .62 proportion looks to target with a normal prime versus approximately .60 for a mispronunced prime. In contrast, they looked less to the target in the unrelated prime condition (approximately .55). Thus, the children in this study showed cascading activation where the mispronunciation activates the mispronounced word which in term activates a semantically related word. Chow, Aimola Davies, and Plunkett (2017) performed a very similar study to the one I present for Aim 1. applied a very similar Visual World Paradigm English-learning 24- and 30-month-olds saw a 2 x 2 grid of images which included a phonological (cohort) competitor and a semantic competitor, and they heard a prompt to view one of the images (Look at the bee). On filler trials, the target word and an unrelated image onscreen alongside the competitors. On test trials, the target word (bee) was not pictured onscreen, so the display had two unrelated images (sandwich, dress), a phonological competitor (bus), and a semantic competitor (cat). They found an early temporary advantage (a growth curve bump) in looks to the phonological competitor, followed by a late, more stable advantage for the semantic competitor. They found that increased receptive vocabulary predicted more looks to the phonological competitor and fewer looks to the semantic competitor. (They interpret the semantic effect as a consequence of the early phonological effect causing children to fixate on the semantic word later.) Their results support a kind of cascading activation: “Toddlers, like adults, extract phonological information from the spoken word faster than they extract semantic information.” The above studies involved young children of different ages tested under different procedures, sometimes in different dialects and languages. Averaging these results together, so to speak, the studies suggest that early word recognition demonstrates some hallmarks of adult behavior: Continuous processing of words, integration of information from different levels of representation, and the influence of similar, unspoken words on recognition of a word. Nevertheless, we only have a fragmented view of how familiar word recognition develops within children. One open question is how lexical competition develops in young listeners. For example, how and when do phonological or semantically similar words exert their influence on word recognition? As a guiding hypothesis, we can think of word learning as a gradual process where familiarity with a word moves from shallow receptive knowledge to deeper expressive knowledge. In adult listeners, words compete and they inhibit one another, so that a word is truly “learned” (integrated into the lexicon) when it can influence the processing of other words (a line of reasoning reviewed by Kapnoula, Packard, Gupta, &amp; McMurray, 2015). Increasing sensitivity to similar sounding or similar meaning words over time would reveal that children more thoroughly learn familiar words with age. 3.2 Individual differences in word recognition We have a rough understanding of the development of word recognition, and these gaps in knowledge matter because young children differ in their word recognition abilities. These differences are usually measured using accuracy (a probability of recognizing to a word) or efficiency (a reaction time or some measure of how quickly accuracy changes over time). These differences are consequential too, as word recognition differences correlate with other language measures concurrently and prospectively. Many studies highlight the predictive power of word recognition ability. Marchman and Fernald (2008) found that vocabulary size and lexical processing efficiency at age 2 jointly predicted working memory scores and expressive language scores at age 8. Fernald and Marchman (2012) found that late talkers who looked more quickly to a named word at 18 months showed larger gains in vocabulary by 30 months compared to late-talkers who looked more slowly at 18 months. Weisleder and Fernald (2013) found that lexical processing and language input at 19 months predicted vocabulary size at 25 months and that lexical processing mediated the effect of language input—the basic idea being that rich language input builds up word recognition ability which in turn supports word learning. Lany (2017) found a direct link between lexical processing and word learning: 18-month-olds and 30-month-olds who were faster at recognizing familiar words were also more accurate at recognizing novel words in a word-learning task. Thus, children who are better at recognizing words learn more words over time and perform better at word-learning tasks. Word recognition performance predicts future language outcomes, so we conclude that individual differences in word recognition are important. But we do not know how word recognition develops within children, so we have no context for evaluating these individual differences. Are these differences in lexical processing persistent over development? Is word recognition a skill where most children catch up and converge on a mature range of performance by a certain age? 3.3 The current study In the previous two sections, I outlined two gaps in knowledge. The first is that we do not have a clear understanding of how the mechanisms underlying word recognition change in early childhood. We know that children show plenty of adult-like features of word recognition, but each of these findings is an isolated fact. What we need is a coherent set of facts that show how specific features of word recognition change with age. The second gap is that although we know that individual differences in word recognition are predictive of later outcomes, we do not have a developmental picture of these individual differences. In this study, I tackle these two lines of research: The development of lexical competition effects and individual differences in familiar word recognition. I report the results of a longitudinal study of word recognition in preschoolers at age 3, age 4, and age 5. The study is described in detail in Chapter 4. Briefly stated, this experiment tested word recognition by presenting prompts like “find the horse” and recording children’s looks to an array of four images. The array of images included the target, a phonological competitor, a semantic competitor, and an unrelated image. In Chapter 5, I analyze the development patterns of familiar word recognition (looks to the target) and how individual differences change over time. In Chapter 6, I study how the phonological and semantic competitors influence word recognition and how the influence of the competitors changes over time. Finally, in Chapter 7, I link these two lines of research together and describe both sets of results in terms of lexical processing dynamics. Chapter @ref(#aim1-h-check) reviews the results of my pre-analysis research hypotheses. References "],

In particular, the participants were 28–39 months-old at Age 3, 39–52 at Age 4, and 51–65 at Age 5. Approximately, 180 children participated at Age 3, 170 at Age 4, and 160 at Age 5. Of these children, approximately 20 were identified by their parents as late talkers. Prospective families were interviewed over telephone before participating in the study. Children were not scheduled for testing if a parent reported language problems, vision problems, developmental delays, or an individualized education program for the child. Recruitment and data collection occurred at two Learning to Talk lab sites—one at the University of Wisconsin–Madison and the other at the University of Minnesota. Table 4.1 summarizes the cohort of children in each year of testing. The numbers and summary statistics here are general, describing children who participated at each year, but whose data may have been excluded from the analyses. Some potential reasons for exclusion include: excessive missing data during eyetracking, experiment or technology error, developmental concerns not identified until later in study, or a failed hearing screening. Final sample sizes will depend on the measures needed for an analysis and the results from data screening checks. I disclose all data exclusions following guidelines by the Center for Open Science (Nosek et al., 2014). Table 4.1: Participant characteristics.

In eyetracking studies with toddlers, two familiar images are usually presented: a target and a distractor. This experiment is a four-image eyetracking task that was designed to provide a more demanding word recognition task for preschoolers. In this procedure, four familiar images are presented onscreen followed by a prompt to view one of the images (e.g., find the bell!). The four images include the target word (e.g., bell), a semantically related word (drum), a phonologically similar word (bee), and an unrelated word (swing). Figure 4.1 shows an example of a trial’s items. This procedure measures a child’s real-time comprehension of words by capturing how the child’s gaze location changes over time in response to speech. Figure 4.1: Example display for the target bell with the semantic foil drum, the phonological foil bee, and the unrelated swing. 4.3 Experiment administration Children participating in the study were tested over two lab visits (on different dates). The first portion of each visit involved “watching movies”—that is, performing two blocks of eyetracking experiments. A play break or hearing screening occurred between the two eyetracking blocks, depending on the visit. Each eyetracking experiment was administered as a block of trials (24 for this experiment and 38 for a two-image task—see Chapter X). Children received two different blocks of each experiment. The blocks for an experiment differed in trial ordering and other features. Experiment order and block selection were counterbalanced over children and visits. For example, a child might have received Exp. 1 Block A and Exp. 2 Block B on Visit 1 and next received Exp. 2 Block A and Exp. 1 Block B on Visit 2. The purpose of this presentation was to control possible ordering effects where a particular experiment or block benefited from consistently occurring first or second. Experiments were administered using E-Prime 2.0 and a Tobii T60XL eyetracker which recorded gaze location at a rate of 60 Hz. The experiments were conducted by two examiners, one “behind the scenes” who controlled the computer running the experiment and another “onstage” who guided the child through the experiment. At the beginning of each block, the child was positioned so the child’s eyes were approximately 60 cm from the screen. The examiners calibrated the eyetracker to the child’s eyes using a five-point calibration procedure (center of screen and centers of four screen quadrants). The examiners repeated this calibration procedure if one of the five calibration points for one of the eyes did not calibrate successfully. During the experiment, the behind-the-scenes examiner monitored the child’s distance from the screen and whether the eyetracker was capturing the child’s gaze. The onstage examiner coached the child to stay fixated on the screen and repositioned the child as needed to ensure the child’s eyes were being tracked. Every six or seven trials in a block of an experiment, the experiment briefly paused with a reinforcing animation or activity. During these breaks, the onstage examiner could reposition the child if necessary before resuming the experiment. We used a gaze-contingent stimulus presentation. First, the images appeared in silence on screen for 2 s as a familiarization period. The experiment then checked whether the child’s gaze was being recorded. If the experiment could continuously track the child’s gaze for 300 ms, the child’s gaze was verified and the trial continued. If the experiment could not verify the gaze after 10 s, the trial continued. This procedure guaranteed that for most trials, the child was looking to the display before presenting the carrier phrase and that the experiment was ready to record the child’s response to the carrier. During year 1 (age 3) and year 2 (age 4), an attention-getter (e.g., check it out!) played 1 s following the end of the target noun. These reinforcers were dropped in year 3 (age 5) to streamline the experiment for older listeners. 4.4 Stimuli The four images on each trial consisted of a target noun, a phonological foil, a semantic foil, and an unrelated word. The phonological competitors shared a syllable onset (e.g., flag–fly, bell–bee), shared an initial consonant (bread–bear, swing–spoon), had a similar phonetically similar consonant onset (kite–gift), or shared a syllable rime (van–pan). The semantic competitors included words from the same category (e.g., shirt–dress, horse–bear), words that were perceptually similar (sword–pen, flag–kite), and words with less obvious relationships (van–horse, swan-bee). A complete list of the items used in the experiment in Appendix A. The stimuli were recorded in both Mainstream American English (MAE) and African American English (AAE), so that the experiment could accommodate the child’s home dialect. Prior to the lab visit, we made a preliminary guess about the child’s home dialect, based on the recruitment channel, address, among other factors. If we expected the dialect to be AAE, then the lab visit was led by an examiner who natively spoke AAE and could fluently dialect-shift between AAE and MAE. At the beginning of the lab visit, the examiner listened to the interactions between the child and caregiver in order to confirm the child’s home dialect. Prompts to view the target image of a trial (e.g., find the girl) used the carrier phrases “find the” and “see the”. These carriers were recorded in the frame “find/see the egg” and cross-spliced with the target nouns to minimize coarticulatory cues on the determiner “the”. The stimuli were re-recorded after the first year of the study with the same speakers so that the average duration of the two dialect versions were more similar. The images used in the experiment consisted of color photographs on gray backgrounds. These images were piloted with 30 children from two preschool classrooms to ensure that children consistently used the same label for familiar objects. The two preschool classrooms differed in their students’ SES demographics: One classroom (13 piloting students) was part of a university research center which predominantly serves higher-SES families, and the other classroom (17 piloting students) was part of Head Start center which predominantly serves lower-SES families. The images were tested by presenting four images (a target, a phonological foil, a semantic foil and an unrelated word) and having the student point to the named image. The pictures had to be recognized by at least 80% of students in each classroom. 4.5 Data screening To process the eyetracking data, I first mapped gaze x-y coordinates onto the onscreen images. I next performed deblinking. I interpolated short runs of missing gaze data (up to 150 ms) if the same image was fixated before and after the missing data run. Put differently, I classified a window of missing data as a blink if the window was brief and the gaze remained on the same image before and after the blink. I interpolated missing data from blinks using the fixated image. After mapping the gaze coordinates onto the onscreen images, I performed data screening. I considered the time window from 0 to 2000 ms after target noun onset. I identified a trial as unreliable if at least 50% of the looks were missing during the time window. I excluded an entire block of trials if it had fewer than 12 reliable trials. Table 4.2 shows the numbers of participants and trials at each year before and after data screening. There were more children in the second year than the first due to a timing error in the initial version of this experiment, leading to the exclusion of 27 participants from the first year. Table 4.2: Eyetracking data before and after data screening. For convenience, the number of exclusions is included as Raw - Screened.

Eye movements have durations on the order of 100 or 200 ms, so capturing data every 16.67 ms oversamples eye movements and can introduce high-frequency noise into the signal. Binning together data from neighboring frames can smooth out this noise. I modeled the looks from 250 to 1500 ms. Lastly, I aggregated looks by child, study and time, and created orthogonal polynomials to use as time features for the model. Figure 4.2 depicts the dataset following the data screening and model preparation steps. The lines start around .25 which is chance performance on four-alternative forced choice task. The lines rise as the word unfolds, and they peak and plateau around 1400 ms. Figure 4.2: Empirical word recognition growth curves from each year of the study.

I used logistic regression because the outcome measurement is a probability (the log-odds of looking to the target image versus a distractor). I used mixed-effects models to estimate a separate growth curve for each child (to measure individual differences in word recognition) but also treat each child’s individual growth curve as a draw from a distribution of related curves. I used Bayesian techniques to study a generative model of the data. Instead of reporting and describing a single, best-fitting model of some data, Bayesian methods consider an entire distribution of plausible models that are consistent with the data and any prior information we have about the models. By using this approach, one can explicitly quantify uncertainty about statistical effects and draw inferences using estimates of uncertainty (instead of using statistical significance—which is not a straightforward matter for mixed-effects models).3 The eyetracking growth curves were fit using an orthogonal cubic polynomial function of time (a now-conventional approach; see Mirman, 2014). Put differently, I modeled the probability of looking to the target during an eyetracking task as: \\[ \\text{log-odds}(\\textit{looking}\\,) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\text{Time}^1 + \\beta_2\\text{Time}^2 + \\beta_3\\text{Time}^3 \\] That the time terms are orthogonal means that \\(\\text{Time}^1\\), \\(\\text{Time}^2\\) and \\(\\text{Time}^3\\) are transformed so that they are uncorrelated. Under this formulation, the parameters \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) have a direct interpretation in terms of lexical processing performance. The intercept, \\(\\beta_0\\), measures the area under the growth curve—or the probability of fixating on the target word averaged over the whole window. We can think of \\(\\beta_0\\) as a measure of word recognition reliability. The linear time parameter, \\(\\beta_1\\), estimates the steepness of the growth curve—or how the probability of fixating changes from frame to frame. We can think of \\(\\beta_1\\) as a measure of processing efficiency, because growth curves with stronger linear features exhibit steeper frame-by-frame increases in looking probability.4 To study how word recognition changes over time, I modeled how the growth curves change over developmental time. This amounted to studying how the growth curve parameters changes year over year. I included dummy-coded indicators for Age 3, Age 4, and Age 5 and allowed these indicators to interact with the growth curve parameters. These year-by-growth-curve-feature terms captured how the shape of the growth curves changed each year. The model also included random effects to represent by-child and by-child-by-year effects to estimate a general growth curve for each child and to estimate how each child’s growth curve changed each year. The models were fit in R (vers. 3.4.3) with the RStanARM package (vers. 2.16.3). Appendix B contains the R code used to fit the model along with a description of the model specifications represented in the model syntax. 5.1.1 Growth curve features as measures of word recognition performance As mentioned above, two of the model’s growth curve features have straightforward interpretations in terms of lexical processing performance: The model’s intercept parameter corresponds to the average proportion or probability of looking to the named image over the trial window, and the linear time parameter corresponds to slope of the growth curve or lexical processing efficiency. I also was interested in peak proportion of looks to the target. I derived this value by computing the growth curves from the model and taking the median of the five highest points on the curve. Figure 5.1 shows three simulated growth curves and how each of these growth curve features relate to word recognition performance. Figure 5.1: Illustration of the three growth curve features and how they describe lexical processing performance. The three curves used are simulations of new participants at Age 4. 5.2 Year over year changes in word recognition performance The mixed-effects model estimated a population-average growth curve (“fixed” effects) and how individual children deviated from average (“random” effects). Figure 5.2 shows 200 posterior samples of the average growth curves for each study. On average, the growth curves become steeper and achieve higher looking probabilities with each year of the study. Figure 5.2: The model estimated an average word recognition growth for each study, and the colored lines represent 200 posterior samples of these growth curves. The thick dark lines represent the observed average growth curve in each study. Figure 5.3 depicts uncertainty intervals with the model’s average effects of each timepoint on the growth curve features. The intercept and linear time effects increased each year, confirming that children become more reliable and faster at recognizing words as they grow older. The peak probability also increased each year. For each effect, the change from age 3 to age 4 is approximately the same as the change from age 4 to age 5, as illustrated in Figure 5.4. Figure 5.3: Uncertainty intervals for the effects of study years on growth curve features. The intercept and peak features were converted from log-odds to proportions to ease interpretation. Figure 5.4: Uncertainty intervals for the differences between study timepoints. Again, the intercept and peak features were converted to proportions. The average looking probability (intercept feature) was 0.38 [90% UI: 0.37, 0.40] at age 3, 0.49 [0.47, 0.50] at age 4, and 0.56 [0.54, 0.57] at age 5. The averages increased by 0.10 [0.09, 0.11] from age 3 to age 4 and by 0.07 [0.06, 0.09] from age 4 to age 5. The peak looking probability was 0.55 [0.53, 0.57] at age 3, 0.68 [0.67, 0.70] at age 4, and 0.77 [0.76, 0.78] at age 5. The peak values increased by 0.13 [0.11, 0.16] from age 3 to age 4 and by 0.09 [0.07, 0.10] from age 4 to age 5. These results numerically confirm the hypothesis that children would improve in their word recognition reliability, both in terms of average looking and in terms of peak looking, each year. The changes in peak probability were also rather large: children’s probability fixating on the target increased by approximately .1 each year. These growths indicate the task scaled with children’s development because they had room to improve each year. Summary. The average growth curve features increased year over year, so that children looked to the target more quickly and more reliably as they grew older. 5.3 Exploring plausible ranges of performance over time Bayesian models are generative; they describe how the data could have been generated. This model assumed that each child’s growth curve was drawn from a population of related growth curves, and it tried to infer the parameters over that distribution. These two aspects—a generative model and learning about the population of growth curves—allow the model to simulate new samples from that distribution of growth curves. That is, we can predict a set of growth curves for a hypothetical, unobserved child drawn from the same distribution as the 195 children observed in this study. This procedure of studying model implications by having the model generate new data is called posterior predictive inference, and in this case, it allows one to explore the plausible degrees of variability in performance at each age. Figure 5.5 shows the posterior predictions for 1,000 simulated participants, and it demonstrates how the model expects new participants to improve longitudinally but also exhibit stable individual features over time. Figure 5.6 shows uncertainty intervals for these simulations. The model learned to predict less accurate and more variable performance at age 3 with improving accuracy and narrowing variability at age 4 and age 5. Figure 5.5: Posterior predictions for hypothetical unobserved participants. Each line represents the predicted performance for a new participant. The three dark lines highlight predictions from one single simulated participant. The simulated participant shows both longitudinal improvement in word recognition and similar relative performance compared to other simulations each year, indicating that the model would predict new children to improve year over year and show stable individual differences over time. Figure 5.6: Uncertainty intervals for the simulated participants. Variability is widest at age 3 and narrowest at age 5, consistent with the prediction that children become less variable as they grow older. I hypothesized that children would become less variable as they grew older and converged on a mature level of performance. To address this question, I inspected the ranges of predictions for the simulated participants. The claim that children become less variable would imply that the range of predictions should be narrower for age 5 than for age 4 and narrower for age 4 than for age 3. Figure 5.7 depicts the range of the predictions, both in terms of the 90 percentile range (i.e., the range of the middle 90% of the data) and in terms of the 50 percentile (interquartile) range. The ranges of performance decrease from age 3 to age 4 to age 5, consistent with the hypothesized reduction in variability. Figure 5.7: Ranges of predictions for simulated participants over the course of a trial. The ranges are most similar during the first half of the trial when participants are at chance performance, and the ranges are most different at the end of the trial as children reliably fixate on the target image. The ranges of performance decreases with each year of the study as children show less variability. The developmental pattern of increasing reliability and decreasing variability was also observed for the growth curve peaks. For the synthetic participants, the model predicted that individual peak probabilities will increase each year, peak3 = 0.55 [90% UI: 0.35, 0.77], peak4 = 0.69 [0.48, 0.86], peak5 = 0.78 [0.59, 0.91]. Moreover, the range of plausible values for the individual peaks narrowed each for the simulated data. For instance, the difference between the 95th and 5th percentiles was 0.43 for age 3, 0.38 for age 4, and 0.32 for age 5. Summary. I used the model’s random effects estimates to simulate growth curves from 1,000 hypothetical, unobserved participants. The simulated dataset showed increasing looking probability and decreasing variability with each year of the study. These simulations confirmed the hypothesis that variability would diminish as children began to demonstrate a mature degree of performance for this task. 5.4 Are individual differences stable over time? I predicted that children would show stable individual differences such that children who are faster and more reliable at recognizing words at age 3 remain relatively faster and more reliable at age 5. To evaluate this hypothesis, I used Kendall’s W (the coefficient of correspondence or concordance). This nonparametric statistic measures the degree of agreement among J judges who are rating I items. For these purposes, the items are the 123 children who provided reliable eyetracking for all three years of the study. (That is, I excluded children who only had reliable eyetracking data for one or two years.) The judges are the sets of growth curve parameters from each year of study. For example, the intercept term provides three sets of ratings: The participants’ intercept terms from year 1 are one set of ratings and the terms from years 2 and 3 provide two more sets of ratings. These three ratings are the “judges” used to compute the intercept’s W. Thus, I computed five groups of W coefficients, one for each set of growth curve features: intercept, Time1, Time2, Time3, and peak looking probability. Because I used a Bayesian model, there is a distribution of ratings and thus a distribution of concordance statistics. Each sample of the posterior distribution fits a growth curve for each child in each study, so each posterior sample provides a set of ratings for concordance coefficients. This distribution of W’s lets us quantify our uncertainty because we can compute W’s for each of the 4000 samples from the posterior distribution. One final matter is how to assess whether a concordance statistic is meaningful. To tackle this question, I also included a “null rater”, a fake parameter that assigned each child in each year a random number. I use the distribution of W’s generated by randomly rating children as a benchmark for assessing whether the other concordance statistics differ meaningfully from chance. Figure 5.8: Uncertainty intervals for the Kendall’s coefficient of concordance. Random ratings provide a baseline of null W statistics. The peak, intercept and linear time features are decisively non-null, indicating a significant degree of correspondence in children’s relative word recognition reliability and efficiency over the three years of the study. I used the kendall() function in the irr R package (vers. 0.84; Gamer, Lemon, &amp; Singh, 2012) to compute concordance statistics. Figure 5.8 depicts uncertainty intervals for the Kendall W’s for these growth curve features. The 90% uncertainty interval of W statistics from random ratings, [.28, .39], subsumes the intervals for the Time2 effect [.30, .35] and the Time3 effect [.28, .35], indicating that these values do not differentiate children in a longitudinally stable way. Earlier, I claimed that only the intercept, linear time, and peak features have psychologically meaningful interpretations and that the higher-order time features mainly act to capture the curvature of the data. These null concordance statistics support that claim because the Time2 and Time3 features differentiate children across studies as well as random numbers. Concordance is strongest for the peak feature, W = [] and the intercept term, W = [], followed by the linear time term, W = []. Because these values are far removed from the statistics for random ratings, I conclude that there is a credible degree of correspondence across studies when ranking children using their peak looking probability, average look probability (the intercept) or their growth curve slope (linear time). Summary. Growth curve features measured individual differences in word recognition performance. By using Kendall’s W to measure the degree of concordance among growth curve features over time, I tested whether individual differences in lexical processing persisted over development. I found that the peak looking probability, average looking probability and linear time features were stable over time. Children who relatively fast (or reliable) at word recognition at one age were also relatively fast (or reliable) at other ages too. 5.5 Predicting future vocabulary size I hypothesized that individual differences in word recognition at age 3 will be more discriminating and predictive of future language outcomes than differences at age 4 or age 5. To test this hypothesis, I calculated the correlations of growth curve features with age 5 expressive vocabulary size and age 4 receptive vocabulary. (The receptive test was not administered during the last year of the study for logistical reasons.) As with the concordance analysis, I computed each of the correlations for each sample of the posterior distribution to obtain a distribution of correlations. Figure 5.9 shows the correlations of the peak looking probability, average looking probability and linear time features with expressive vocabulary size at age 5, and Figure 5.10 shows analogous correlations for the receptive vocabulary at age 4. For all cases, the strongest correlations were found between the growth curve features at age 3. Growth curve peaks from age 3 correlated with age 5 vocabulary with r = .52 [90% UI .50, .54], but the concurrent peaks from age 5 showed a correlation of just r = .31 [.29, .33], a difference between age-3 and age-5 correlations of r3−5 = .21 [.18, .24]. A similar pattern held for lexical processing efficiency values. Linear time features from age 3 correlated with age 5 vocabulary with r = .41 [.39, .44], whereas the concurrent lexical processing values from age 5 only showed a correlation of r = .28 [.26, .31], a difference of r3−5 = .13 [.10, .16]. For the average looking probabilities, the correlation for age 3, r = .39 [.39, .44], was probably only slightly greater than the correlation for age 4, r3−4 = .02 [−.01, .04] but considerably greater than the concurrent correlation at age 5, r3−5 = .08 [.05, .10]. Figure 5.9: Uncertainty intervals for the correlations of growth curve features at each timepoint with age-5 expressive vocabulary (EVT-2 standard scores). The bottom rows provide intervals for the pairwise differences in correlations between timepoints. For example, the top row of the left panel is the correlation between age-3 peak probability and age-5 expressive vocabulary. Peak looking probabilities from age 3 were strongly correlated with age 4 receptive vocabulary, r = .62 [.61, .64], and this correlation was much greater than the correlation observed for the age 4 growth curve peaks, r3−4 = .26 [.23, .29]. The correlation for age 3 average looking probabilities, r = .45 [.44, .47], was greater than the age 4 correlation, r3−4 = .08 [.06, .11], and the correlation for age 3 linear time features, r = .51 [.49, .54], was likewise greater, r3−4 = .22 [.19, .26]. Figure 5.10: Uncertainty intervals for the correlations of growth curve features from age 43 and age 44 with age-4 receptive vocabulary (PPVT-4 standard scores). The bottom row shows pairwise differences between the age-3 and age-4 correlations. Summary. Although individual differences in word recognition were stable over time, early differences were more significant than later ones. The strongest predictors of future vocabulary size were the growth curve features from age 3. Of these features, correlations were strongest for peak looking probabilities. 5.6 Discussion In the preceding analyses, I examined many aspects of children’s recognition of familiar words. First, I modeled how children’s looking patterns on average changed year over year. Children’s word recognition improved each year: The growth curves grew steeper, reached higher peaks, and increased in their overall average value each year. This result was unsurprising, but it was valuable because it confirmed that this word recognition task scaled with development. The task was simple enough that children could recognize words at age 3 but challenging enough for children’s performance to improve each year. After establishing how the averages changed each year, I next asked how variability changed each year. To tackle this question, I used posterior predictive inference to have the model simulate samples of data, and in particular, to simulate new participants. The range of performance narrowed each year, so that children were most variable at age 3 and least variable at age 5. This result is consistent with a model of development children vary widely early on and converge on a more mature level of performance. From this perspective, word recognition is a skill where children “grow out” of immature and highly variable performance patterns. An alternative outcome would have been concerning: Word recognition differences that expanded with age with some children falling behind their peers. Although the range of individual differences decreased with age, individual differences did not disappear over time. When children at each age were ranked using growth curve features, I found a high degree of correspondence among these ratings. Children who were faster or more accurate at age 3 remained relatively fast or accurate at age 5. Thus, differences in word recognition were longitudinally stable over the preschool years. Extrapolating forwards in time, these differences likely become smaller and smaller and become irrelevant for everyday listening situations. It is plausible, however, that under adverse listening conditions, individual differences might re-emerge and differentiate children’s word recognition performance. Lastly, I analyzed how individual differences in word recognition features correlated with future vocabulary outcomes. The peak looking probabilities and growth curve slopes from age 3 showed the strongest correlations with future vocabulary scores. This finding was remarkable: Expressive vocabulary scores at age 5, for example, were more strongly correlated with word recognition data collected two years earlier than word recognition data collected during the same week. We can understand the predictive value of age-3 word recognition performance from two perspectives. The first interpretation is statistical. Differences in children’s word recognition performance were greatest at age 3, so word recognition features at age 3 provide more variance and more information about the children and their future vocabulary size. The second interpretation is conceptual. Correlations were strongest for the growth curve peaks. We can think of this feature as measuring children’s maximum word recognition certainty. A child with a peak of .5, for example, looked the target image half of the time when they were most certain about the word. Although all of the words used were familiar to preschoolers, children with higher peaks knew those words better. These children had a stronger foundation for word-learning than children who show more uncertainty during word recognition, and as a result, these children had developed larger vocabularies two years later.

Following our approach in Law et al. (2016), I only examined trials for which the phonological foil and the noun shared the same syllable onset. For example, this criterion included trials with dress–drum, fly–flag, or horse–heart, but it excluded trials kite–gift (phonetic feature difference), bear–bread (onset difference), and ring–swing (rimes). I kept 13 of the 24 trials. Appendix A provides a complete list of trials used. The outcome measure for these analyses was the log-odds of fixating on the phonological competitor versus the unrelated word. Because children looked more to the target word with each year of the study, they necessarily looked less to the distractors each year. Figure 6.1 illustrates how the proportions of looks to the phonological foils declined each year. Therefore, I examined the effect of the phonological foil in comparison to the unrelated foil. For example, on the trials where the target is fly, we can study the effect of the phonological foil flag by looking at when and to what degree the children fixate on flag more than the unrelated image pen. If a window of time of shows a consistent advantage for the phonological foil over the unrelated image, we conclude that the children were sensitive to the phonological foil during that window. By studying the time course of fixations to the phonological competitor versus the unrelated word, we can identify when the phonological competitor affected word recognition most significantly. Figure 6.1: Because children looked more to the target as they grew older, they numerically looked less the foils too. This effect is why I evaluated the phonological and semantic foils by comparing them against the unrelated image. As in the models from the previous chapter, I downsampled the data into 50-ms (3-frame) bins in order to smooth the data. For these trials, I modeled the looks from 0 to 1500 ms, and I aggregated looks by child, study and time bin. To account for the sparseness of the data, I used the empirical log-odds (or empirical logit) transformation (Barr, 2008). This transformation adds .5 to the looking counts. For example, a time-frame with 4 looks to the phonological foil and 1 look to the unrelated image has a conventional log-odds of log(4/1) = 1.39 and empirical log-odds of log(4.5/1.5) = 1.10. This transformation fills in bins with 0 looks with .5/.5 (avoiding 0/0 problems), and it dampens the extremeness of some probabilities that arise in sparse count data. To model these data, I fit a generalized additive model with fast restricted maximum likelihood estimation (see Sóskuthy, 2017 for a tutorial for linguists; Winter &amp; Wieling, 2016; Wood, 2017). Box 1 provides a brief overview of these models. I used the mgcv R package (vers. 1.8.24; Wood, 2017) with support from the tools in the itsadug R package (vers. 2.3; van Rij, Wieling, Baayen, &amp; van Rijn, 2017).5 Appendix B contains the R code used to fit these models along with a description of the specifications represented by the model syntax. Box 1: Intuition behind generalized additive models. In these analyses, the outcome of interest is a value that changes over time in a nonlinear way. We model these time series by building a set of features to represent time values. In the growth curve analyses of familiar word recognition, I used a set of polynomial features which expressed time as the weighted sum of a linear trend, a quadratic trend and cubic trend. That is: \\[ \\text{log-odds}(\\mathit{looking}) = \\alpha + \\beta_1 * \\textit{Time}^1 + \\beta_2 * \\textit{Time}^2 + \\beta_3 * \\textit{Time}^3 \\] But another way to think about the polynomial terms is as basis functions: A set of features that combine to approximate some nonlinear function of time. Under this framework, the model can be expressed as: \\[ \\text{log-odds}(\\mathit{looking}) = \\alpha + f(\\textit{Time}) \\] This is the idea behind generalized additive models and their smooth terms. These smooths fit nonlinear functions of data by weighting and adding simple functions together. The figures below show 9 basis functions from a “thin-plate spline” and how they can be weighted and summed to fit a growth curve. Each of these basis functions is weighted by a model coefficient, but the individual basis functions are not a priori meaningful. Rather, it is the whole set of functions that approximate the curvature of the data—i.e., f(Time)—so we statistically evaluate the whole batch of coefficients simultaneously. This joint testing is similar to how one might test a batch of effects in an ANOVA. If the batch of effects jointly improve model fit, we infer that there is a significant smooth or shape effect at play. Smooth terms come with an estimated degrees of freedom (EDF). These values provide a sense of how many degrees of freedom the smooth consumed. An EDF of 1 is a perfectly straight line, indicating no smoothing. Higher EDF values indicate that the smooth term captured more curvature from the data. The model included main effects of study year. These parametric terms work like conventional regression effects and determined the growth curve’s average values. The model used age 4 as the reference year, so the intercept represented the average looking probability at age 4. The year effects represented differences between age 4 vs. age 3 and age 4 vs. age 5. The model also included smooth terms to represent the time course of the data. As with the parametric effects, age 4 served as the reference year. The model estimated a smooth for age 4 and it estimated difference smooths to capture how the curvature at age 3 and age 5 differed from the age-4 curvature. Each of these study-level smooths used 10 knots (9 basis functions). I also included child-level random smooths to represent child-level variation in growth curve shapes. Because there is much as less data at the child level than at the study level, these random smooths only included 5 knots (4 basis functions). We can think of these simpler splines as coarse adjustments in growth curve shape to capture child-level variation from limited data. Altogether, the model contained the following terms: \\[ \\small \\begin{align*} \\text{emp. log-odds}(\\mathit{phon.\\ vs.\\ unrelated}) =\\ &amp; \\alpha + \\beta_1\\text{Age3} + \\beta_2\\text{Age5} +\\ &amp;\\text{[growth curve averages]} \\\\ &amp; f_1(\\text{Time}, \\text{Age4})\\ + &amp;\\text{[reference smooth]} \\\\ &amp; f_2(\\text{Time}, \\text{Age4} - \\text{Age3})\\ + &amp;\\text{[difference smooths]} \\\\ &amp; f_3(\\text{Time}, \\text{Age4} - \\text{Age5})\\ + &amp; \\\\ &amp; f_i(\\text{Time}, \\text{Child}_i) &amp;\\text{[by-child random smooths]} \\\\ \\end{align*} \\] The model’s fitted values are shown in Figure 6.2. These are the average empirical log-odds of fixating on the phonological foil versus the unrelated image for each year of the study. The model captured the trend for increased looks to the competitor image with each year of the study. At age 4 and age 5, the shape rises from a baseline to the peak around 800 ms. These curves slope downwards and eventually fall beneath the initial baseline. The shape at age 3 does not have a steady rise from baseline and shows a small peak around 800 ms. The peak proportions of looks to the phonological competitor versus the unrelated word were .57 at 800 ms for age 3, .61 at 750 ms for age 4, and .64 at 750 ms for age 5. Figure 6.2: With each year of the study, children looked more to the phonological competitor (relative to the unrelated image) during and after the target noun. Both figures show means for each year estimated by the generalized additive model. The left panel compares model estimates to observed means and standard errors, and the right panel visualizes estimated means and their 95% confidence intervals. The early peaks occur when one would expect if children are acting on partial phonological information. The similarity between the phonological competitor and the target noun occurs early on in the trial. Suppose a child acts on the first 400 ms of the phonological competitor. Assuming a 200–300 ms overhead to execute an eye movement in response to speech, the child would reach the phonological foil around 600–700 ms. This window is slightly before the observed peaks at 750–800 ms, but the age 4 and age 5 curves both are on the rise away from baseline during this window. The average looks to the phonological foil over the unrelated image for age 4 was 0.16 emp. log-odds, .54 proportion units. The averages for age 3 and age 4 did not significantly differ, p = .85, but the average value was significantly greater at age 5, 0.31 emp. log-odds, .58 proportion units, p &lt; .001. Visually, this effect shows up in the almost constant height difference between the age-4 and the age-5 curves. There was a significant smooth term for time at age 4, estimated degrees of freedom (EDF) = 7.28, p &lt; .001. Figure 6.3 visualizes how and when the smooths from other studies differed from the age-4 smooth. Figure 6.3: Differences in the average looks to the phonological competitor versus the unrelated image between age 4 and the other ages. Plotted line is estimated difference and the shaded region is the 95% confidence interval around that difference. Boxes highlight regions where the 95% interval excludes zero. From age 3 to age 4, children become more sensitive to the phonological foil during and after the target noun. The linear difference curve for age 4 versus age 5 indicates that the two years largely have the same curvature, but they steadily diverge over the course of the trial. The age-3 and age-4 curves significantly differed, EDF = 5.48, p &lt; .001. In particular, the curves are significantly different from 500 to 1050 ms. This result confirms that the looks to the phonological foil increased from age 3 and age 4 during the time window immediately following presentation of the noun and that children became more sensitive to the phonological similarities between the competitor and the target from age 3 to age 4. The age-3 and age-4 curves also differed significantly after 1250 ms, so that at age 4 children looked less to the competitor compared to age 3. The effect reflects how the looks to phonological competitor decrease as a trial progresses. After an incorrect look to the foil, the children on average corrected their gaze and looked even less to the phonological foil. We do not observe this degree of correction during age 3, because children at age 3 looked less overall to the phonological foil early on. The age-4 and age-5 smooths also significantly differed, EDF = 1.00, p &lt; .001, although the low EDF values indicates that the shape of the difference was a flat line. Thus, the difference between the age-4 and age-5 smooths is driven primarily by the intercept difference and a linear diverging trend—that is, the distance between the two grows slowly over time. The same general curvature was observed for the two studies, suggesting the same general looking behavior at both time points: Children showed an early increase in looks to the phonological foil relative to the unrelated image but after receiving disqualifying information from the rest of the word, the looks to the phonological foil rapidly decrease. The primary difference between age-4 and age-5 is that the competitor effect becomes more pronounced at age 5. Summary. Children looked more to the phonological competitor than the unrelated image early on in the trials. The advantage of the phonological competitor peaked on average around 800 ms after target onset, and the early timing indicates that children were shifting their gaze in response to the fleeting phonological similarity of the competitor to the target noun. The peak was small at age 3 but increased in height with each year of the study. Children became more sensitive to the phonological cohort competitors as they grew older. 6.2 Looks to the semantic competitor I asked how children’s sensitivity to the semantic competitor changed as they grew older. As in Law et al. (2016), I only examined trials for which the semantic foil and the noun were part of the same category. For example, I included trials with bee–fly, shirt–dress, and spoon–pan, but I excluded trials where the similarity was perceptual (sword–pen) or too abstract (swan–bee). This criterion kept 13 of the 24 trials. Appendix A provides a complete list of trials used. For these trials, I used the same modeling technique as the one used for phonological competitors: Generalized additive models with study effects and a time smooth, time-by-study difference smooths, and time-by-child random smooths. I modeled the looks from 250 to 1800 ms. This window was 300 ms longer than the one used for the phonological competitors in order to capture late-occurring semantic effects. The model’s fitted values are shown in Figure 6.4. The average empirical log-odds of fixating on the semantic competitor versus the unrelated word increased with each year of the study. All three years show the same general time course of effects: Looks begin to increase from a baseline around 750 ms and peak around 1300 ms. The peak proportions of looks to the semantic competitor versus the unrelated word increased as children grew older: The peaks were .65 at 1400 ms for age 3, .68 at 1400 ms for age 4, and .71 at 1350 ms for age 5. Moreover, the semantic competitor shows a decisive advantage over the unrelated image at age 3, in contrast to the limited advantage of the phonological competitor at age 3. Figure 6.4: With each year of the study, children looked more to the semantic foil (relative to the unrelated image) with peak looking occurring after the target noun. Both figures show means for each year estimated by the generalized additive model. The left panel compares model estimates to observed means and standard errors, and the right panel visualizes estimated means and their 95% confidence intervals. The average looks to the semantic foil over the unrelated image for age 4 was 0.44 emp. log-odds, .61 proportion units. Children looked significantly less to the semantic foil on average at age 3, 0.30 emp. log-odds, .57 proportion units, p &lt; .001, and they looked significantly more to the semantic foil at age 5, 0.50 emp. log-odds, .62 proportion units, p &lt; .001. There was a significant smooth term for time at age 4, estimated degrees of freedom (EDF) = 7.04, p &lt; .001. Figure 6.5 visualizes the time course of the differences between the smooths from each study. Figure 6.5: Differences in the average looks to the semantic competitor versus the unrelated word between age 4 and the other ages. Plotted line is estimated difference and the shaded region is the 95% confidence interval around that difference. Boxes highlight regions where the 95% interval excludes zero. The flat line on the left reflects how the shape of the growth curves remained the same from age 3 to age 4 and only differed in average height. From age 4 to age 5, the lines quickly diverge and the age-5 curve reaches a higher peak value. The shapes of the age-3 and age-4 curves did not significantly differ, EDF = 1.00, p = .535. The age-3 curve begins to rise about 100 ms later, and it reaches a shallower peak value than the age-4 curve. These two features create a nearly constant height difference between the two curves, and thus the two curves show the same overall shape. The age-4 and age-5 smooths significantly differed, EDF = 3.74, p &lt; .001. The differences are greatest after the end of the target noun, in the window from 750 to 1500 ms. The two curves start from a similar baseline but quickly diverge as the age-5 curve reaches a higher peak value. After 1500 ms, the age-5 curve turns downwards to overlap with the age-4 curve. Children looked more to the semantic foil relative to the unrelated image, but they were also quicker to correct and look away from it. Summary. Children became more sensitive to the semantic competitor, compared to the unrelated word, with each year of the study. The semantic foils clearly influenced looking patterns at age 3, in contrast to the muted effect observed for the phonological foils. The semantic effect also occurred when we would expect: After the end of the target noun, following the lexical activation of the target noun and its semantic neighbors. 6.3 Child-level differences in competitor sensitivity at age 3 Next, I asked whether children differed reliably in their sensitivity to the phonological and semantic foils based on speech perception and vocabulary measures collected at age 3 As a measure of speech perception, I used scores from a minimal pair discrimination experiment administered during the first year of the study. [citations] The task is essentially an ABX discrimination task: A picture of a familiar object is shown and labeled (e.g., “car”), another object is shown and labeled (“jar”), and then both images are shown and one of the two is named. The child then indicated which word they heard by tapping on the image on a touch-screen. I derived speech perception scores by fitting a hierarchical item-response model. This logistic regression model estimates the probability of child i correctly choosing word j on word-pair k. The equation below provides a term-by-term description of the model. The model’s intercept term represents the average participant’s probability of correctly answering for an average item. By-child random intercepts capture a child’s deviation from the overall average, so they estimate the child’s ability. By-word and by-word-in-pair random intercepts capture the relative difficulty of particular items on the experiment. The by-word-in-pair effects were necessary because four words appeared in more than one word pair (e.g., juice–goose and juice–moose). The model also controlled for the children’s ages and receptive vocabulary scores (PPVT-4 growth scale values). These predictors were transformed to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1, so the model’s intercept reflected a child of an average age and an average vocabulary level. Therefore, the by-child intercepts reflect a child’s ability after controlling for age and receptive vocabulary. \\[ \\small \\begin{align*} \\text{log-odds}(\\mathit{choosing\\ correct\\ word}) =\\ &amp; \\alpha\\ + &amp;\\text{[average participant ability]} \\\\ &amp; \\alpha_i\\ + &amp;\\text{[difference of participant}\\ i \\text{&#39;s ability from average]} \\\\ &amp; \\alpha_j\\ + &amp;\\text{[word}\\ j\\text{&#39;s difficulty]} \\\\ &amp; \\alpha_{j,k}\\ + &amp;\\text{[word}\\ j \\text{&#39;s difficulty in word-pair}\\ k] \\\\ &amp; \\beta_{1}\\text{Age}\\ + &amp;\\text{[participant-level predictors]} \\\\ &amp; \\beta_{2}\\text{Vocabulary} &amp; \\\\ \\end{align*} \\] I tested whether phonemic discrimination ability at age 3 predicted looks to the phonological competitor over the unrelated image by modifying the generalized additive model from earlier. In particular, I included a smooth term for the phonemic discrimination ability score and a “smooth interaction” between the smooth of time and phonemic ability. These smooth interaction terms are analogous to interaction terms in linear models. In this case, the interaction term allows the ability score to change the shape of the time trend. The additive model was therefore: \\[ \\small \\begin{align*} \\text{emp. log-odds}(\\mathit{phon.\\ vs.\\ unrelated}) =\\ &amp; \\alpha +\\ &amp;\\text{[growth curve average]} \\\\ &amp; f_1(\\text{Time})\\ + &amp;\\text{[time smooth]} \\\\ &amp; f_2(\\text{Ability})\\ + &amp;\\text{[ability smooth]} \\\\ &amp; f_3(\\text{Time} * \\text{Ability})\\ + &amp;\\text{[interaction smooth]} \\\\ &amp; f_i(\\text{Time}, \\text{Child}_i) &amp;\\text{[by-child random smooths]} \\\\ \\end{align*} \\] The model included data from 144 participants; these were children with eyetracking data, receptive vocabulary and phonemic discrimination data at age 3. There was not a significant smooth effect for discrimination ability, EDF = 1.00, p = .551 or for an interaction smooth between time and ability, EDF = 8.37, p = .303. To test the role of receptive vocabulary, I also fit analogous models using growth scale value scores from the PPVT-4, a receptive vocabulary test. I first adjusted these scores in a regression model to control for–that is, to partial out the effects of—age and predicted accuracy on the discrimination task. There was not a significant smooth effect for receptive vocabulary, EDF = 1.00, p = .868, or a significant interaction smooth between time and receptive vocabulary, EDF = 5.57, p = .610. Receptive vocabulary therefore was not related to looks to the phonological foil at age 3. I tested the same two predictors on looks to the semantic foil at age 3. These child-level factors did not show any significant parametric effects, smooth effects or smooth interactions with time. Thus, children’s looks to the semantic foil were not reliably related to phonemic discrimination or receptive vocabulary. Summary. These models tested whether two child-level factors—minimal-pair discrimination ability and receptive vocabulary—predicted looks to the phonological and semantic competitors at age 3. No significant effects were observed for all cases. 6.4 Discussion In the preceding analyses, I examined children’s fixation patterns to the phonological and semantic competitors and how these fixation patterns changed over developmental time. With each year of the study, children looked more to the target overall, so they consequently looked less to the competitor images each year. To account for this fact, these analyses examined the ratio of looks to the competitors versus the unrelated word. This ratio measured the relative advantage of a competitor over the unrelated word. 6.4.1 Immediate activation of phonological neighbors Developmentally, children became more sensitive to the phonological competitors with each year of the study. These words shared the same syllable onset as the target noun—for example, the pairs dress–drum or fly–flag. The competitors affected word recognition early on, with relative looks to the phonological foils peaking around 800 ms. The target nouns were approximately 800 ms in duration at age 3 and 550–800 ms at later ages. Assuming a 200–300 ms overhead for executing an eye movement in response to speech, this timing indicates that children shifted their gaze immediately, based on partial information. Moreover, the tendency to act on partial information became stronger with age, because the early advantage of the phonological competitor increased with each year of the study. When children looked to the phonological competitor, they fixated on the wrong image and had to revise their interpretation of the noun. At ages 4 and 5, the early peaks of looks to the phonological competitor were followed by a steep, monotonic decrease in looks: Children rejected their initial interpretation of the word and considered other images. At age 3, the average pattern showed more wiggliness, suggesting that children were less decisive in rejecting the phonological competitor. The shapes of the looking patterns at age 4 and age 5 were essentially the same. In particular, the older children were not any faster in the rejecting the phonological competitor on average. We can interpret these findings in terms of lexical processing dynamics. Under this view, incoming speech activates phonetic and phonemic and lexical representations. The word with the strongest activation is the favored interpretation and the object of the child’s fixations. The early looks to the phonological competitors reflect immediate activation of lexical units: Children activate words on the basis of partial acoustic information. This result is a hallmark of spoken word recognition. The activation of phonologically plausible words becomes stronger with age, as reflected in children’s increasing sensitivity to the phonological competitors. Some mechanisms that may explain this developmental pattern include changes in lexical organization so that neighborhoods of phonologically similar words coactivate and changes in lexical representations so that partial information can more eagerly activate compatible words.6 Children at age 4 and age 5 did not show any changes in how quickly they rejected the phonological foil, and this result suggests that lexical inhibition may not change over the preschool years. The reasoning is as follows: If children developed stronger lexical inhibition with age, so that lexical competition resolves more quickly, then we would expect activation of the phonological competitors to decay more quickly and for children to reject the phonological competitor more quickly. But this pattern is not what we observed in the growth curve analyses.7 The developmental trajectory here is one of increased activation, of children learning words and learning similarities among them so that phonological similar words participate in word recognition. 6.4.2 Late activation of semantic neighbors The semantic competitors were from the same category as the target noun: for example, bee–fly or shirt–dress. Children showed year-over-year increases in their sensitivity to the semantic competitor, compared to the unrelated image. Looks the semantic foils started rising steadily 500–700 ms after target onset and peaked late in the trial, around 1300 ms. This time-course is more protracted than the immediate peaks observed for the phonological competitor. In terms of lexical processing, this late timing is consistent with cascading activation: Spoken words immediately activate phonological neighborhoods with activation cascading onto semantically related words. As a particular word is favored, its semantic relatives receive more secondary activation. For example, children hear “find the shirt”, activate the target shirt, but also activate other pieces of clothing including dress. The late timing of looks to the semantic competitor therefore reflects late, secondary activation of the spoken word’s semantic relatives. In other words, the activation of a semantic neighbor (like dress) is greatest when the activation of the spoken word (shirt) is greatest which happens relatively late, once the competition among phonological alternatives resolves. Under this account, children hear a word, activate it, and become increasingly likely to fixate on the semantic competitor, compared to the unrelated image. The late looks probably reflect a combination of behaviors: children considering the semantically related image to check their initial interpretation as well as children looking to the wrong image because of confusion, lack of knowledge, overriding activation from the semantic competitor, or lack of interest in the target. Initially, I had subscribed to a confusion or lack-of-knowledge interpretation of the semantic competitor’s advantage. That is, children look to the semantic competitor because they do not know the difference between the target and the semantic competitor. After all, my thinking went, these were young children and decisions like bee vs. fly or goat vs. sheep can be difficult. But there are two objections to that line of reasoning. First, our lab piloted the set of words in preschool classrooms, so we confirmed that children could reliably and correctly point to bee even when fly is an alternative. Second, we would a priori expect that children’s confusion among words to be greatest when they are youngest and have much less experience with these semantic categories. (Indeed, children at age 3 looked less to the target overall, so in general, they were less successful at recognizing the target word.) The late looks to the semantic competitor, relative to the unrelated image, however, were greatest at age 5. Children’s looks became more selective with age: They looked more to the semantic competitor because they had discovered the semantic connections among words. They had learned the similarity between bee and fly or shirt and dress. Put another way, to demonstrate confusion between two choices, children must learn some association that connects the two; they must use or activate some information that induces warranted uncertainty. Rather than confusion about the meaning of nouns, the late looks likely reflect a confirmatory behavior where children give some consideration to the semantic alternative. This is especially the case at age 5, where the advantage of semantic competitor quickly decreases after its peak, indicating rejection of the semantic competitor. 6.4.3 Lexical competitors and child-level predictors I asked whether offline child-level measures predicted sensitivity to the phonological and semantic competitors at age 3. I used children’s ability scores from a minimal-pair discrimination task as a measure of phonemic speech perception, and I also used scores from a receptive vocabulary test. For the phonological competitor, I expected that children with better phonemic discrimination would show increased looks to the phonological competitor because they had more detailed phonemic representations that would activate phonological neighborhoods more quickly. For the semantic competitor, I likewise expected children with larger receptive vocabularies to show increased looks to the semantic competitor because these children knew more words and likely developed more semantic connections among the words. I tested these effects by using the scores as parametric effects to see if they predicted average looks to the competitor, and alternatively, by using the scores for smooth effects to see if they influenced the time course of looks to the foils. None of these expectations held: Neither of the child-level measures predicted average sensitivity to the phonological or semantic competitors at age 3. Part of the result may be artifactual: The data—looks to a subset of images on a subset of trials—may be too limited at the individual level for the models to pick up on child-level effects. Part of the result may be developmental too: Children were least sensitive to the competitors at age 3, so individual differences may be too small for the data or models to capture. Further work, with different experimental designs, may elaborate on whether offline measures can reliably detect differences in sensitivity to lexical competitors during word recognition.

The word recognition data came from a visual-world eyetracking experiment which recorded children’s fixations to images in response to prompts like see the bear. The trials featured a target noun (e.g., bear) along with a phonological competitor (bell), a semantic competitor (horse), and an unrelated image (ring). To describe children’s word recognition ability, I analyzed how the probability of fixating on the target image changed over the time course of a trial. The presence of the competitor images also allowed additional analyses about children’s sensitivities to the phonological and semantic competitors. The experiment was conducted as part of a three-year longitudinal study; children were 28–39 months-old at the Age 3 visit, 39–52 at Age 4, and 51–65 at Age 5. The longitudinal design allowed me to describe developmental changes in word recognition. 7.1 How to improve word recognition Children showed year-over-year improvements in word recognition, as measured by average looking probabilities, peak looking probabilities, and the rate of change in looking probabilities. Children became more reliable, less uncertain, and faster at recognizing familiar words as they grew older. At the same time, children also became more sensitive to the phonological and semantic competitors, compared to the unrelated images. With each year, children looked more to the target image, but when they erred, they were more likely to err on a lexically relevant word. We can interpret these developmental patterns in terms of lexical activation and processing dynamics. In this task, children hear a stream of speech and activate some phonetic, phonological, lexical, and semantic representations that match the speech input. As they hear more of a word, the activation builds until a particular word is favored, and children shift their gaze onto the named image. Let’s imagine that we have to engineer this system. To make word recognition more efficient, we have to find ways to increase the relative activation of the correct word. In particular, we can boost the strength of connections so that activation can propagate more quickly through the system, and we can also allow inhibition among competing words so that the correct word can win out over its competitors more quickly. The results from these studies indicate that children become more efficient at activating the target word and related words over the preschool years. As they grew older, children were faster to look at a named image and more likely to fixate on the phonological competitor (compared to the unrelated image). These two findings reflect changes in how partial acoustic information can propagate to activate phonologically plausible words. The phonological competitors shared the same syllable onset as the target noun (e.g., dress–drum), so the early part of the word matched both words. That children became more sensitive to the phonological competitor means that they learned and somehow encoded the phonological similarities among words because part of a word could activate a neighborhood of phonologically plausible matches. This developmental change supports faster word recognition because the listener can channel activation to relevant words more quickly. A similar line of reasoning applies to the semantic competitors: Relative looks to the semantic competitors increased with age, suggesting that children had learned semantic connections among words and activated semantically related words during word recognition. The other mechanism we might tune to improve word recognition is inhibition. Children’s looks to the phonological or semantic competitors were temporary: Looks increase to some peak level and then quickly decrease. Behaviorally, the drop in looking probability reflects the rejection of an interpretation: for example, a child hears “dr”, shifts looks to dress, but hears “um”, revises the interpretation and jumps to drum. We can read these corrections as evidence for an inhibitory process: Corrections indicate a change in relative activation where a different word overrides an initial interpretation. But the evidence for developmental changes in lexical inhibition from these data was scant. The rate of rejection of the phonological competitor—that is, how quickly looks fall from their peak value—did not change from age 4 to age 5, although the rate did increase for the semantic competitor from age 4 to age 5. Preschoolers did demonstrate inhibition by revising their interpretations of nouns, but there were no clear developmental changes in inhibition. Previous simulation work can help identify more specific mechanisms at play. McMurray, Samelson, Lee, and Tomblin (2010) used the TRACE model of word recognition (McClelland &amp; Elman, 1986) to simulate looks to a target and phonological competitors (cohorts and rimes) in adolescents with specific language impairment. The authors tuned a number of model parameters and analyzed how those changes affected simulated looks to the target and competitors. In the current dataset, I observed a developmental trend where the relative looks to the phonological competitors peak higher each year. In those TRACE simulations, looks to the cohort competitor peak higher if 1) the rate of lexical activation increased, 2) the rate of lexical decay decreased, or 3) strength of lexical inhibition decreased. Of these options, the growth curve for the decrease in lexical inhibition best matches the shape of the current data. The similarity does not mean that children inhibited words any less as they grew older. That would be too simplistic: Developmental changes in preschoolers are the result of simultaneous changes in many mechanisms. But those simulation results suggest that an increase in lexical inhibition is not one of the key developmental changes in preschoolers’ word recognition. 7.2 Learn words and learn connections between words Preschoolers showed increased activation of the target noun and semantically and phonologically related words but little developmental change in lexical inhibition. Paired with the findings from older children, these results lead to a compelling developmental story. Rigler et al. (2015) compared 9- and 16-year-olds on a visual-world word recognition experiment with phonological (cohort and rime) competitors. The younger children were slower to look to the target image and showed more looks to the competitors. The implications are that children’s word recognition is still developing in late childhood and that in particular, children’s inhibition of lexical competitors became stronger with age. The current study with 3-, 4-, and 5-year-olds followed a different pattern: Relative looks to the competitor images increased with age. Taken together, these two studies suggest an interesting progression for the development of lexical processing. During the preschool years, children learn many, many words, and they establish phonological and semantic connections between these words. These connections support the immediate activation of neighborhoods of related words. Later childhood, based on the Rigler et al. (2015) findings, then is a time for refinement of those connections so that sensitivity to the competitors decreases. This refinement could follow from more selective activation channels, increased lexical inhibition, changes in resting activation (to favor more frequent words), or likely a combination of these factors. 7.3 Individual differences are most important at younger ages Another dimension of this study concerned individual differences in word recognition. Some children were faster or more accurate during word recognition, and these children also were more likely to be faster or more accurate at later ages. The magnitude of these differences diminished over time, as children approached a more mature level of performance. In terms of lexical processing dynamics, we might think of early differences as reflecting early differences in the burgeoning lexicon. Children may have different numbers of words, different degrees of experience with some words, less established connections among words, and at a lower level, different phonetic and speech perception abilities, given the links between speech perception in infancy and early vocabulary development (Cristia, Seidl, Junge, Soderstrom, &amp; Hagoort, 2014). Differences in word recognition are greatest early on in development because this is when the differences among children’s lexicons are greatest. The task of learning new words, and more importantly, of developing representations and associations to organize words normalizes the early differences among children’s lexicons. That pressure would make the overall variability among children decrease over time while still preserving a relative ordering among children. We can also interpret the predictive power of word recognition measures in terms of lexical processing and lexical organization. Correlations between word recognition performance and future vocabulary were strongest for the age-3 growth curve features, particularly for the peak probability of looking to the target word. The peak probability measures the overall certainty in word recognition and how strongly the target word is activated. Children with more efficient representations of familiar words at age 3 have a stronger foundation for encoding and integrating future words, and as a result, they showed larger vocabularies at age 4 and age 5. Initially, I had expected processing speed—as approximated by growth curve slopes—to be the most predictive measure of vocabulary growth. Children who can more quickly recognize words, the reasoning goes, can take in information more quickly and devote extra processing resources towards learning.8 Processing speed was indeed correlated with future vocabulary size, yet peak probability was a stronger predictor of future vocabulary size. Granted, these two processing measures are highly related; to hit a higher peak by time x, a growth curve needs to start from higher baseline or have steeper slope. The idea of uncertainty suggests an alternative explanation of the predictive power of word recognition: Children who are more accurate (or less uncertain) during word recognition can extract and activate more information from the speech signal. 7.4 Limitations and implications The discussion of processing speed and word recognition certainty highlights one limitation of this research: The experiment’s four-image, eyetracking-based design meant that a clean measure of processing speed was not feasible. Other eyetracking studies with two images can use the latency of how long it takes the child to shift between images as a measure like reaction time. This approach does not translate to the four-image design, as children can visit multiple images on their way to the target. Visual world studies with older participants can obtain an explicit reaction time measure by means of a mouse click or tap on a touchscreen, but those additional task demands may not translate to young children like those in this study. Thus, this study could not address directly whether the predictive power of word recognition performance reflects a more developed lexicon, a general reaction-time-like speed advantage, or both. The experimental design included semantic and phonological competitors on every trial, so isolating out the semantic and phonological competition effects required some subtlety. A more direct design would compare different types of a trials: for example, trials with a target vs. three unrelated images intermixed with trials with a target vs. a competitor vs. two unrelated images. The trials also used different kinds of phonological and semantic competitors. For example, two of the phonological competitors rhymed with the target, so they could not be included the analysis of phonological competitors (which focused on just competitors with the same onset as the target). The current design limited the number of trials that could be used in the analyses of the competitors and weakened the power of the analyses. A final limitation includes the changes in the experiment procedure over the course of the longitudinal study. From age 3 to age 4, we re-recorded the stimuli (with the same original speakers) so that the noun durations between the two different dialect versions of the experiment were similar. From age 4 to age 5, we also shortened the duration of the trials by removing attention-getting prompts (e.g., this is fun!) from the ends of the trials. These small procedural changes mean that year-to-year differences do not reflect pure development differences. It is implausible, however, that the robust year-over-changes owe more to procedural changes than a year of learning and language development. The findings from this study have implications for our understanding of word recognition and word learning. The first is the overall developmental narrative. Preschool children become better at recognizing words by learning similarities among words and using those similarities to activate neighborhoods of lexically relevant words. Rather than just measuring vocabulary size, word recognition reveals how well words have been integrated into the lexicon. The developmental trends here show that familiar words become more integrated and more connected over the preschool years. Even if a child knows a word at age 3 well enough to recognize or express it, their knowledge of the word will strengthen over time as the word develops connections to other similar words. From this perspective, we can think of individual differences in word recognition as differences in lexical development. Variability in word recognition diminishes over time, so that differences are more predictive and discriminating at younger ages. Thus, if we wanted to intervene on word recognition, these results indicate that early intervention is better and that intervention should build connections among words and should target words that build onto existing semantic and phonological networks. The natural closing of gaps in word recognition performance with age, however, suggests that word recognition in and of itself may not be an important intervention target. Rather, word recognition measures should serve to supplement other vocabulary measures as an indicator of lexical processing and lexical integration. References "],
["aim1-h-check.html", "Chapter 8 Hypothesis check (Specific Aim 1)", " Chapter 8 Hypothesis check (Specific Aim 1) Here I revisit my pre-analysis hypotheses. Children’s accuracy and efficiency of recognizing words will improve each year. Yes. Their curves reached higher heights and showed steeper slopes each year. There are stable individual differences in lexical processing of familiar words such that children who are relatively fast at age 3 remain relatively fast at age 4 and age 5. Yes. The rankings of children by lexical processing measures (peak probability, average probability, linear slope) were concordant over the three years. However, the magnitude of these individual differences diminishes over time, as children converge on a mature level of performance for this paradigm. Yes. I simulated new longitudinal participants based on what the model learned about the observed children. The range of plausible looking proportions narrowed each year, so individual differences became less variable each year. Consequently, individual differences in word recognition at age 3, for example, will be more discriminating and predictive of age 5 language outcomes than differences at age 4 or age 5. Yes. Correlations between growth curve features with future vocabulary measures were strongest for the age 3 growth curve features. Children will become more sensitive to lexical competitors as they age, based on the hypothesis that children discover similarities among words as a consequence of learning more and more words. Yes. The advantage of the phonological competitor and semantic competitor over the unrelated word with development. Children will differ in their sensitivity to lexical competitors, and these individual differences will correlate with other child-level measures. No evidence to support or refute this hypothesis. I did not find a relationship between age-3 measures with the phonological or semantic competitors. In principle, however, one could derive a measure from the competitor looking curves that does correlate with child-level measures. "],

Thus, this experiment used the same participants, the same stimulus preparation and style, and the same general experimental procedure as those reported in detail in Chapter 4. 9.1 Mispronunciation task This experiment is an adaptation of the mispronunciation detection task by White and Morgan (2008) and Law and Edwards (2015). In the experiment, two images are presented onscreen—a familiar object and an unfamiliar object—and the child hears a prompt to view one of the images. In the correct pronunciation (or real word) and mispronunciation conditions, the child hears either the familiar word (e.g., soup) or a one-feature mispronunciation of the first consonant of the target word (shoup). These conditions are designed to test whether children associate mispronunciations with novel objects. To encourage fast referent selection, there were also trials in a nonword condition where the label was an unambiguous novel word (e.g., cheem presented with images of a bed and a novel-looking pastry mixer). Each nonword was constructed to match the phonotactic probability of one of the mispronunciations. Figure 9.1 shows the screens used in two trials. Importantly, within a block of trials, the child never hears both the correct and mispronounced forms of the same word. A child hearing “duck” then a few trials later hearing “guck” would provide a basis of comparison so that the child can decide that “guck” is probably not “duck”—the design used here avoided this situation and is a change from the design of Law and Edwards (2015). Figure 9.1: Example displays for a trial in which duck is mispronounced as “guck” (left) and a trial in which the nonword “cheem” is presented (right). In a block of the experiment, there were 12 trials each from the correct production, mispronunciation, and nonword conditions, and children received two blocks of the task. A complete list of the items used in the experiment over the three years of the study is included in Appendix C. 9.2 Visual stimuli The images used in the experiment consisted of color photographs on gray backgrounds. As in the familiar word recognition experiment, these images were piloted in two preschool classrooms. Piloting confirmed that children consistently used the same label for familiar objects. For the novel objects, the children reported to not know a word for the object, or if they did name the object, they did not consistently use the same word for an object. 9.3 Novel word retention tests At age 5, following the second block of this task, we tested children’s retention of the labels for the novel objects. They were first tested using an open-set procedure: They were shown each of the images and asked to name it. I will not analyze or report those results, because children seldom named the novel objects using the labels from the task. For example, the rainbow-filled flasks used for sooze (mispronounced shoes) were called science, potions, magic, bottles, among other labels. Following the open-set naming test, children had a closed-set recognition test. Two of the novel objects were paired. One of the objects was from a mispronunciation trial and the other was from a nonword trial. For example, the flasks (sooze) were paired with the trolley (geeve) from the nonword condition. The pairs were yoked, as each nonword was designed to have the same phonotactic probability as one of the mispronunciations. During the retention test, children saw two images of the novel objects (say, trolley1.jpeg and flasks1.jpeg), heard one of novel labels (geeve), and had to point to the named object. In a later trial during testing, the other label (sooze) was tested but using different images for the objects (trolley2.jpeg and flasks2.jpeg). In a block of testing, there were 12 trials, 6 for nonwords and 6 for mispronunciations. 9.4 Data screening Table 9.1 shows the numbers of participants and trials excluded during each of year of the study due to unreliable data. There were more children in the second year than the first year due to a timing error in the initial version of this experiment, leading to the exclusion of 30 participants from the first year. Table 9.1: Eyetracking data counts before and after data screening. Dataset Study Children Blocks Trials Raw Age 3 177 341 12245 Age 4 181 349 12600 Age 5 164 325 11736 Screened Age 3 162 305 9062 Age 4 170 320 10031 Age 5 157 306 10113 Raw − Screened Age 3 15 36 3183 Age 4 11 29 2569 Age 5 7 19 1623 After mapping the gaze coordinates onto the onscreen images, I performed data screening following the same set of steps as in Chapter 4. To make data quality judgments, I only considered the window from 0 to 2000 ms after noun onset. Next, I identified a trial as unreliable if at least 50% of the looks were missing during the time window, and I excluded an entire block of trials if it had fewer than 18 reliable trials. As an additional criterion, I excluded participants who failed to provide at least 6 reliable trials per experimental condition. 9.4.1 Classifying trials based on initial fixation location During preliminary visualization of the study-level growth curves, I observed an increasing preference for the unfamiliar image for the nonword condition. The growth curves showed a typical pattern of a baseline at noun onset followed by a quick change in height as the word unfolded. For the nonword condition, this baseline level moved further from .5 (chance with two images) with each year of the study: Children became more likely to fixate on the novel object at the start of these trials. Because this was a two-image task, I was able to account for the location of the child’s gaze at the onset of the target noun. For each trial, I counted the number of looks to the familiar object and the unfamiliar object during the first 250 ms after target noun onset (specifically, 0 ≤ time &lt; 250 ms). If the majority of the looks landed on the familiar object, then the trial was a familiar-initial trial. An analogous rule labeled trials as unfamiliar-initial trials. Ties were broken by favoring the earlier fixated image. For example, a tie might be a trial with 7 frames of looking to the unfamiliar image, followed by 1 frame between the two images, followed by 7 frames to the familiar image. In this case, the unfamiliar image was viewed first, so the trial is classified as unfamiliar-initial. If there were no looks to either image during that window, the trial was not classified for either image and it was excluded. Table 9.2 shows the counts and percentages of trial classification. About 5% of trials were excluded because the child looked to neither image during the first 250 ms of the noun onset. The table shows how the percentage of unfamiliar-initial trials increased with each year of the study. Accounting for this trend was the rationale for classifying trials based on the initial fixation location. Table 9.2: Number of trials classified based on initial fixation location.

I modeled looks from 300 to 1,500 ms after noun onset. Lastly, I aggregated looks by child, study, condition, initial fixation location, and time, and I created orthogonal polynomials to use as time features for the model.

I fit a Bayesian mixed-effects logistic regression growth-curve model, as in Chapter 5. For the real word and nonword conditions, there is a well-defined target image: the familiar image for real words and the novel/unfamiliar image for nonwords. The outcome measures were the probabilities of fixating to the target image in each condition: P(look to familiar image | hear a real word) P(look to unfamiliar image | hear a nonword) Both the real word and nonword conditions measure referent selection as the probability of fixating on the appropriate referent when presented with a label. The important analytic question is whether and to what degree these two probabilities differ. The growth curve model is similar to the one in Chapter 5 with linear, quadratic and cubic time features but it adds a condition effect which interacts with these features. The linear model was: \\[ \\small \\begin{align*} \\text{log-odds}(\\mathit{looking\\,}) =\\ &amp;\\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\text{Time}^1 + \\beta_2\\text{Time}^2 + \\beta_3\\text{Time}^3\\ + &amp;\\text{[nonword growth curve]} \\\\ (&amp;\\gamma_0 + \\gamma_1\\text{Time}^1 + \\gamma_2\\text{Time}^2 + \\gamma_3\\text{Time}^3)*\\text{Condition} \\ &amp;\\text{[adjustments for real words]} \\\\ \\end{align*} \\] I fit a separate model for each year of the study. Appendix D contains the R code used to fit these models along with a description of the specifications represented by the model syntax. The mixed model included by-child and by-child-by-condition random effects to allow some of a child’s growth curve features to be similar between conditions (by-child effects) and to differ between conditions (by-child-by-condition effects). For these analyses, I limited focus to distractor-initial trials, and modeled the data from 300 to 1500 ms after target onset. I removed any Age × Child levels if a child had fewer than 4 fixations in a single time bin. In other words, children had to have at least 4 looks to one of the images in every 50 ms time bin. This screening removed 13 children at age 3, 15 at age 4, and 6 at age 5. Figure 10.1 shows the group averages of the growth curves. For each condition and age, I computed the empirical growth curve for each participant, and I averaged the participants’ growth curves together to obtain group averages. I also applied this process to 100 model-estimated growth curves. Figure 10.1: Averages of participants’ growth curves in each condition and age. The lines represent 100 posterior predictions of the group average. In Chapter 5, I claim that for these growth curve models only the intercept and linear time terms are behaviorally meaningful model parameters. The intercept measures the average growth curve value so it reflects overall looking reliability, and the linear time term measures the overall steepness of the growth so it reflects lexical processing efficiency. I also derived a measure of peak looking probability by taking the median of top five points in a growth curve, and this peak provides a measure of word recognition certainty. Higher peaks indicate less uncertainty about a word. I evaluated the general condition effects by looking at how the population-level (“fixed”) effects differed in each condition. Due to ceiling effects, where children’s growth curves saturated 100% looking probabilities, the population-level average growth curve outperformed the observed group averages in Figure 10.1. The condition differences described by these population-level effects, however, do qualitatively match the patterns in the group averages. The two conditions did not reliably differ at age 3. The population-level average proportion of looks to the target for nonwords was .60 [90% UI: .55, .65], compared to .56 [.51, .60] for real words—a difference (nonword advantage) of .05 [−.01, .11]. For the linear time feature, the nonword slope increases by 9% [−1%, 18%] in the real word condition. Both these 90% intervals include 0 as a plausible estimate for the condition difference, so there is uncertainty about the sign of the effect. I therefore conclude that the conditions did not credibly differ on average at age 3. There was an advantage for the nonword condition at age 4 and age 5. The population-level average proportion of looks for the nonwords was .79 [90% UI: .76, .82], compared to props4$b_Real for real words. On average, children looked less to target for the real words than the nonwords. There was a suggestive effect linear time effect where the nonword curve was 13% [1%, 25%] steeper than the real word one. The curve for real words was probably less steep at age 4 but small values near 0 remain plausible. At age 5, only the average probability difference was credible, .81 [90% UI: .78, .83] for nonwords compared to props5$b_Real for real words. In general, children performed better in the nonword condition than the real word condition at age 4 and age 5. This difference shows up in the growth curve model through intercept effects, although it is plausible that children’s nonword growth curves were steeper than the real word curves at age 4. I analyzed the children’s model-estimated growth curve peaks. Each posterior sample of the model represents a plausible set of growth curve parameters for the data, so for each of these samples, I calculated the growth curves for each child and the peaks of the growth curves. Figure 10.2 shows the the posterior averages of the growth curves peaks for each participant. Figure 10.2: Growth curve peaks by child, condition and year of the study. The movement of the medians conveys how the nonword peaks effect increased from age 3 to age 4 and the real word peaks increased from age 4 to age 5. The piling of points near the 1.0 line depicts how children reached ceiling performance on this task. Descriptive statistics reveal the developmental trends for this task. At age 3, the median peak values were similar for the two conditions: .84 for nonwords and .83 for real words. The peaks increased for the nonword condition in the following year with a median value of .92. It is worth emphasizing what this statistic tells us: At age 4, half of the children had a peak looking probability of .92 or greater. In other words, half the children performed near the ceiling on this task by age 4. At age 5, the median nonword peak was .93, essentially unchanged from age 4. For the real words, the median peak increased from .82 at age 4 to .89 at age 5. To quantify the degree of ceiling performance, I calculated the number of children per condition with a growth curve peak greater than or equal to .99 over the posterior distribution. For the nonword condition, there were 23 [90% UI: 20, 26] children who performed at ceiling at age 3, 41 [36, 45] at age 4, 40 [36, 44] and at age 5. For the real word condition, the number of children attaining ceiling performance was more uneven: there were 20 [16, 24] ceiling-performers at age 3, 13 [10, 16] at age 4, and 13 [10, 16] at age 5. To compare peaks looking probabilities between ages, I fit a linear mixed effects model with restricted maximum likelihood via the lme4 R package (vers. 1.1.17; Bates, Mächler, Bolker, &amp; Walker, 2015). I regressed the children’s average growth curve peaks onto experimental condition, age group, and the age × condition interaction. The model included randomly varying intercepts for child and child × age. This modeling software does not provide p-values for its effects estimates, so for these comparisons, I decided that an effect was significant when the t statistic for a population-level (“fixed”) effect had an absolute value of 2 or greater. In practical terms, this convention interprets an effect as “significant” when its estimate is at least 2 standard errors away from 0. (Gelman and Hill (2007) use this approach when with mixed models.) At age 3, the two conditions did not significantly differ, Breal-nonword = .01, t = 0.95. At age 4, nonword peaks were on average .09 proportion units greater than the real word peaks, t = 5.79, and at age 5, the nonword peaks were .04 proportion units greater than the real word peaks, t = 2.56. For the nonword condition there was a significant increase in the peaks from age 3 to age 4, B4-3 = .10, t = 5.99, whereas there was no improvement from age 4 to age 5, t = 0.37. In the real word condition, there was only a significant improvement from age 4 to age 5, B5-4 = .06, t = 3.25. Finally, I asked whether expressive vocabulary size correlated with peak looking performance on the two conditions. Correlations among real word peaks, nonword peaks, expressive vocabulary and receptive vocabulary are given in Table XX. At all three years, children with larger vocabularies had higher nonword peak looking values. At age 3 and age 4, vocabulary positively correlated with real-word looking performance. Figure 10.3 illustrates the relationship between the peaks and expressive vocabulary. When there is more variability in the peaks, as at age 3, the vocabulary effect on the nonwords is strongest. Table 10.1: Correlation between curve peaks and vocabulary measures Study Real word peak Nonword peak PPVT-4 standard Age 3 Nonword peak r(149) = .24** PPVT-4 standard r(139) = .23** r(139) = .46*** EVT-2 standard r(137) = .15 r(137) = .30*** r(137) = .69*** Age 4 Nonword peak r(155) = .29*** PPVT-4 standard r(152) = .15 r(152) = .23** EVT-2 standard r(153) = .23** r(153) = .20* r(152) = .78*** Age 5 Nonword peak r(151) = .13 EVT-2 standard r(149) = −.06 r(149) = .23** Figure 10.3: Text reference for caption Summary. Children performed similarly for real words and nonwords at age 3. Children’s processing of nonwords improved at age 4. At this age, performance also began to saturate with the group average for peak looking probability greater than .9 for the nonword condition. Consequently, children did not improve in processing of nonwords from age 4 to age 5. For the real word condition, children’s performance did not change from age 3 to age 4 but it did improve from age 4 to age 5. At both age 4 and age 5, there was a decisive advantage for the nonword condition. Finally, children with larger expressive vocabularies looked more to the nonwords compared to children with smaller vocabularies. A comparable effect for real words was observed at age 3 and age 4 but only reliably observed at age 4. 10.2 Does age 3 referent selection better predict age 5 vocabulary? I hypothesized that performance on the nonword condition would be a better predictor of future vocabulary size than the real word condition. This hypothesis follows from the assumption that fast referent selection, as opposed to familiar word recognition, is a more relevant skill for word-learning. Put another way, a child’s ability to quickly map a novel word to a referent is more closely related to the demands of in the moment word-learning than familiar word recognition. In Chapter 5, I found that peak looking probability at age 3 positively correlated with age 5 vocabulary. Pairing this finding with my hypothesis, I predicted that the growth curve peaks in the nonword condition at age 3 would be better predictors of vocabulary at age 5 than the real word peaks at age 3. For these analyses, I regressed age-5 expressive vocabulary (EVT-2) standard scores onto age-3 expressive vocabulary score and onto age-3 real word peaks or age-3 nonword peaks. There were 116 children with data available for this analysis. There was an expectedly strong relationship between age 3 and age 5 vocabulary, R2 = .49. A 1-SD (18-point) increase in vocabulary at age 3 predicted an 0.7-SD (10-point) increase at age 5. There was no effect of age-3 real-word peak over and above age-3 vocabulary, p = .59. There was a significant effect of the nonword peak, p = .005, ΔR2 = .03, over and above age-3 vocabulary. A .1 increase in nonword peak probability predicted a 0.10-SD (1.4-point) increase in age-5 vocabulary. Figure 10.4 depicts the difference between the two conditions with a flat line for the real condition and small slope for the nonword condition. Figure 10.4: Marginal effects of age-3 referent selection measures on age-5 expressive vocabulary standard scores. The vocabulary scores were adjusted (residualized) to control for age-3 vocabulary, so these regression lines show the effects of the predictors over and above age-3 vocabulary. Finally, I tested whether the difference between nonword and real word peaks within children predicted vocabulary growth. By themselves, differences do not convey much information about how well the child performed: A difference of 0 can happen if a child has peaks of .1 in both conditions or .9 in both conditions. To control for general referent selection performance, therefore, I also included the within-child averages of the two peaks. The model predicted age-5 vocabulary using the within-child average of the peaks, the nonword advantage, and age-3 vocabulary. In this case, condition-averaged performance did not significantly predict age-5 vocabulary, p = p_both. The condition differences did predict age-5 vocabulary: A .1 increase in the nonword condition advantage predicted a 0.08-SD (1.1-point) increase in age-5 vocabulary, p = p_both Summary. A child’s performance in the nonword condition at age 3 positively predicted expressive vocabulary size at age 5. This effect held even when controlling age-3 vocabulary size, and the effect emerged when using the absolute growth curve peak or using the relative advantage of the nonword condition over the real word condition. Although the effects were significant, the effect sizes were small. The EVT-2 is normed to have an IQ-like scale with a mean of 100 and standard deviation of 15. An increase of .1 in age-3 growth curve peak predicted an increase in age-5 vocabulary of 1.4, approximately one tenth of the test norms’ standard deviation. 10.3 Discussion For this discussion, I limited discussion to the main results. For these two conditions, I hypothesized were word recognition in the real word condition would be easier than in the nonword condition, or failing that, the two conditions would not reliably differ. I had discounted a third possibility of any overall advantage for nonwords over real words. The advantage of nonwords at age 4 and age 5 over real words was an therefore unexpected result. Why would children perform better for the nonword trials? The results are consistent with a novelty bias in referent selection (Horst, Samuelson, Kucker, &amp; McMurray, 2011). Alternatively, the presense of the mispronunciation trials, analyzed in chapter XX, may undermine familiar word recognition. For one-third of the trials, children hear a bad version of a familiar word and they show more uncertain responses to them. This could make recognition of familiar words more difficult by priming children to not rely as heavily on syllable-initial sounds for recognition. In contrast, the nonword trials are unambiguous. Children also showed limited year-over-year changes in this task. Indeed, many children obtained ceiling performance with growth curve peaks at .99 or greater. Therefore we might say that children have mastered nonword fast-referent selection in a two-alternative forced choice context by age 4. talk about vocab effects The findings here replicated those of Bion, Borovsky, and Fernald (2013), namely that concurrent vocabulary size positively predicted the amount of looking to the novel object on nonword trials. talk about how nonword peaks were weak predictors of growth In this experiment, children heard more words in total (6). The 3-year-olds in our study had the same peak looking proportion for both kinds of words around .83. CHildren’s year-over-year development on this task was limited. References "],

The design of the task allows the child to associate a mispronunciation with an unfamiliar object or with the familiar object with a name that sounds like the mispronunciation. As a result, I analyzed the mispronunciation trials separately for both initial-fixation locations. One analysis handled trials where a child’s gaze started on the familiar object and another analysis handled trials starting on the unfamiliar object. For these models, I fit a Bayesian logistic regression growth curve model that included indicators for Age and Time × Age interactions, as in the model from Chapter 5. The linear model was therefore: \\[ \\small \\begin{align*} \\text{log-odds}(\\mathit{looking}) =\\ &amp;\\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\text{Time}^1 + \\beta_2\\text{Time}^2 + \\beta_3\\text{Time}^3\\ + &amp;\\text{[age 3 growth curve]} \\\\ (&amp;\\gamma_{0} + \\gamma_{1}\\text{Time}^1 + \\gamma_{2}\\text{Time}^2 + \\gamma_{3}\\text{Time}^3)*\\text{Age}\\,\\text{4} + \\ &amp;\\text{[adjustments for age 4]} \\\\ (&amp;\\delta_{0}\\!\\ + \\delta_{1}\\text{Time}^1\\!\\ + \\delta_{2}\\text{Time}^2\\!\\ + \\delta_{3}\\text{Time}^3)*\\text{Age}\\,\\text{5} \\ &amp;\\text{[adjustments for age 5]} \\\\ \\end{align*} \\] The mixed effects model included by-child and by-child-by-age random effects so that it would capture how a child’s growth curve features may be similar over developmental time (by-child effects) and may differ at each age (by-child-by-age effects). Appendix D contains the R code used to fit these models along with a description of the model’s specification/syntax. For these analyses, I modeled the data from 300 to 1500 ms after target onset. As in the real word vs. nonword analyses, I removed any Age × Child levels if the child’s data had fewer than 4 fixations in a single time bin. As a result, children had to have at least 4 looks to one of the two images in every 50-ms time bin. For the unfamiliar-initial trials, this screening removed 6 children at age 3, 6 at age 4, and 2 at age 5, and for the familiar-initial trials, this screening removed 1, 4, and 0 children at ages 3, 4, and 5, respectively. 11.1 Unfamiliar-initial trials: Move along now When preschoolers started on the image of a novel object and heard a mispronunciation, they looked to the familiar image. Figure 11.1 shows the average of children’s growth curves along with the 100 model-estimated group averages. The growth curves all cross the .5 threshold, so the children on average looked more to the familiar than the unfamiliar image. Granted, the degree of referent selection is not as strong as that observed for the real words or nonwords. For those conditions, the average growth curve reached a peak of around .77 at age 3, but for the mispronunciations the age-3 peak is around .62. Children also were comparatively slower to process mispronunciations. For the real-word condition, the average age-3 growth curve crosses .5 looking probability around 775 ms after target onset, whereas in the mispronunciation condition, this threshold is crossed at 1000 ms. Children associate the mispronunciation with the familiar object, although they are slower and show greater uncertainty compared to real word trials. Figure 11.1: Averages of participants’ growth curves in each age. The lines represent 100 posterior predictions of the group average. Of the growth curve features, developmental changes were only observed for the average probability (intercept) and peak probability features. At age 3, the average proportion of looks to the familiar image was .37 [90% UI: .34, .40]. At age 4, the looking proportion increased by .04 [−.01, .08] to .40 [.37, .44]. This year-over-year change was probably positive, but the the uncertainty interval still includes a change of 0 as a plausible result. Visually, this uncertainty appears in the growth curve plot by how close together the age-3 and age-4 growth curves appear. At age 4, the average proportion of looks increased by .07 [.03, .12] to .48 [.45, .51]. Here, there is more certainty that the year-over-year change was positive, and this result is consistent with the visual separation of the age-5 growth curve from the others. In short, performance was similar for age 3 and age 4 but there was a marked improvement at age 5. Figure 11.2 shows participant’s growth curve peaks for each year of the study. The peaks were computed as in other chapters by taking the median of the five highest values on the curve. The average of the participants’ peak looking probabilities followed the same pattern as the average looking probabilities: similar levels at age 3 and age 4 (.63 versus .64) but a clear gain in looking peak probability at age 5 (.69). Figure 11.2: Growth curve peaks by age for mispronunciation trials starting on the unfamiliar image. Figure 11.2 also indicates how most of the children at each age favored the familiar object over the unfamilar object. The bottom hinge of the boxplots mark the location of the 25th percentile. Therefore, approximately 75% of children at age 3 were on or above the .5 threshold. Unlike the other conditions, very few listeners achieve a peak of looking probability of .99: At age 5, only 3 [1, 5] children reached ceiling performance, compared to approximately 40 for nonwords and 13 for real words. None of the other growth curve features showed developmental changes. That is, there were no credible year-over-year changes for the linear, quadratic or cubic time components of the growth curve. Although Figure 11.1 shows children’s probability of looking to the familiar image increasing more quickly at age 5, this effect cannot be clearly tied to any of the model’s polynomial time features. After 600 ms, the age-5 curve is almost parallel to other curves. This visual feature is consistent with the intercept effect: The curve is higher than the others on average, but it does not show any differences in shape. 11.1.1 Child-level predictors I tested whether child-level measures predicted looking behavior under these conditions. First, I asked if performance on a minimal pair discrimination task at age 3 predicted looking behavior at age 3. The rationale here is the hypothesis that children with better minimal pair discrimination may be especially sensitive to mispronunciations. Proportion of items correct on the task did not correlate with growth curve peaks, r = −.03 [90% UI: −.05, −.01], n = 138, nor with any other growth curve measures. I also tested whether expressive vocabulary (EVT-2 standard score) predicted performance in this condition. In this case, there were significant effects at age 3 where a higher expressive vocabulary predicted higher peak probabilities and higher average probabilities. These effects, however, were very small. As shown in Figure 11.3, for example, a 15-point increase in expressive vocabulary predicted an increase of growth curve peak of .03, R2 = .03. Expressive vocabulary did not predict any of the growth curve features at age 4 or at age 5. Figure 11.3: Relationship between expressive vocabulary and growth curve peaks for mispronunciation trials starting on the unfamiliar image. I took 100 draws from the posterior distribution and computed participant’s growth curve peaks for each draw. Points represent the mean and standard error of 100 peaks. Lines represent regressions fit on each draw. Summary. When children are looking at the unfamiliar object and hear a mispronunciation, they shift their looks on average to the familiar image that sounds like the mispronunciation. Children are much more uncertain in this condition, compared to the real-word and nonword conditions where the appropriate referent is more obvious. The only developmental changes observed were the increases in average looking probability and peak looking probability at age 5. Finally, there was a small effect of expressive vocabulary on looking probability at age 3, but no other effects of vocabulary were observed. Minimal pair discrimination at age 3 also did not predict looking behavior. 11.2 Familiar-initial trials: Should I stay or should I go? The preceding results showed that preschoolers associate one-feature onset-mispronunciations with the familiar word that matches the rime of the word. But that was only for trials where children start on the unfamilar object. I now consider the other situation, where children are fixating on a familiar object and hear a word that immediately mismatches with the name of that familiar object. On the basis of the first segment, children have information that supports switching to another image. But as the rest of the word unfolds, they hear a syllable rime that supports staying. Figure 11.4 shows the growth curve averages for trials starting on the familiar image. The looking patterns show a sharp fall towards .5 which is chance-level performance. Behaviorally, children on average move quickly to look at both images equally. They rush into maximum uncertainty, especially at age 4. Patterns are somewhat more restrained at age 5. Here, the average of the growth curves never dips below .5, and in fact, it shows a late rise to .6 looking probability. At this age, children are overall more likely to stay on the familiar object. Finally, at age-3, the curve begins to fall later than the other curves, reflecting a slower change from the starting probability. Figure 11.4: Averages of participants’ growth curves in each age. The lines represent 100 posterior predictions of the group average. In other analyses, growth curves rise and plateau, and age-related effects appear in how quickly the curves rise or the height at which they plateau. In those cases, it is straightforward to interpret how the intercept and linear time effects contribute to the curve’s shape over development. For this model, the curves fall and plateau, and there is not an obvious developmental, year-over-year change among the curves. Thus, more effort is required to interpret the model parameters and how they combine to form the growth curve shape. Figure 11.5 visualizes how the growth curve features are weighted at each year and how they contribute to the overall growth curve shape. At age 3, the intercept feature, or average proportion of looks to the familiar image, was .68 [90% UI: .65, .71]. The feature is less meaningful in this situation because the curves all start at a high probability which inflates the average value. That said, comparisons remain useful. At age 4, the average probability decreased by .05 [.02, .09] to .63 [.60, .66], and at age 5 the average probability returns to age-3 levels, .68 [.65, .71]. This intercept effect contributes to how the age-4 curve dips below the others and indeed briefly crosses the .5 probability threshold. Figure 11.5: Weighted growth curve features. For the first four panels, the y axes are scaled to the same range. This scaling highlights how the cubic time component contributes less to the overall shape than the other features. For the linear time feature, the slope becomes flatter year over year, decreasing by 19% [7%, 29%] from age 3 to age 4 and decreasing by 30% [17%, 42%] from age 4 to age 5. For these curves, however, the starting location is the highest value on the curve, so the linear time feature in this case mostly works to set the starting location of the curves. When the features are combined in Figure 11.5, the age-3 curve, which has the steepest linear time feature, starts at a higher value than the others. There was a credible change in the quadratic time feature at age 5. One way to think of a positive quadratic trend is like a weight hanging on a string: It pulls and bends the whole curve downwards. At age 5, the quadratic feature is 12% [1%, 22%] smaller than at age 4, meaning that the age-5 curve has slightly less bend downwards. Finally, there were no credible differences in the cubic time feature. Compared to the other features, the cubic trend only a small amount to the overall shape of the curves. The combination of these effects shows in the final panel of Figure 11.5. The age-4 curve dips down furthest beneath 0 log-odds (.5 probability)—this is driven by in the intercept feature. The age-5 curve stays above 0 log-odds and eventually starts to rise away from its minimum value, owning to the dampened linear and quadratic features. Summary. The shape of the average growth curves changed with each year of the study. Given the interplay of the curve features, I will avoid assigning a developmental intepretation to individual features. There are two main noticeable developmental trends at play however. First, the age-3 curve starts to fall from its baseline probability a little later than the other curves. Second, the age-5 curve stays above .5 probability and starts to rise at the end of the trial. At age 5, children were more likely stay looking at the familiar object than look at both images equally. 11.2.1 Child-level predictors and different listening behaviors In other word recognition analyses, I derived a growth curve “peak” value as a measure of maximum looking probability or minimum word recognition uncertainty. For these trials, I asked whether analogous growth curve “valleys” provided a meaningful feature for looking behavior when children start a trial fixated on the familiar image. This value was defined as the median of the five smallest values of a growth curve. Intuitively, it reflects the maximum degree to which the novel image is considered as a referent for the mispronunciation. Figure 11.6 shows the posterior means of participants’ growth curve valleys. Note that there is considerable variability at each age, with the 0–1 interval nearly covered at age 4. The median value is closer to .5 at age 5, and this difference is consistent with the growth curve trajectories where the average age 5 curve had did not dip as low as the other curves. Figure 11.6: Growth curve peaks by age for mispronunciation trials starting on the familiar image. The wide range of values for the growth curve valleys suggests that there are a few different listening behaviors that are being averaged over in the above analyses. The valleys above .6, for example, indicate that some children on average stay with the familiar image, and the valleys below .4 indicate children who favor the unfamiliar image. To explore individual listening behaviors, I visualized children’s individual growth curves based on their growth curve valleys. Within each year, I grouped children into sextiles based on the posterior mean of the their valley and plotted their individual growth curves. Figure 11.7 shows the results from age 3. The final two bins show children who stayed with the familiar image throughout the mispronuciation trials. The first two bins mostly contain children who switched to the unfamilar image and stayed there. These are also children whose curves show a pronounced u-shaped trajectory. Specifically, the curves with the highest ending points in the first three bins highligh children with u-shaped trajectories. In these curves, the probability of fixating on the familiar image briefly decreases, as the child considers the other image. Figure 11.7: Growth curves for mispronunciations trials starting on the unfamilar object at age 3. Children were grouped into sextiles based on the posterior mean of the growth curve valley—that is, the lowest point on the growth curve. Ten lines are drawn per child to visualize uncertainty. Children were assigned colors arbitrarily. On the right side of each panel are “rugs” which mark the valleys in that panel. I asked whether any child-level factors predicted children’s looking behaviors. I first regressed growth curve valleys on EVT-2 standard score. There was a small effect at age 3, R2 = .09, n = 145. A 15-point increase in expressive vocabulary predicted decrease in growth curve valley of .05. At the other ages, the effects are neglibly small, as shown in Figure 11.8. Figure 11.8: Relationship between expressive vocabulary and growth curve valleys for mispronunciation trials starting on the familiar image. Valleys were computed on 100 draws of the posterior distribution. Points represent the mean and standard error of the valleys. Lines represent the fit of the regression in each draw. Although the slopes of age-4 and age-5 lines are noticeably different from the age-3 one, they cover a tiny amount of the y axis so they represent a neglible effect. I regressed age-3 valleys onto expressive vocabulary, minimal-pair discrimination accuracy, and their interaction. The two main effects and their interaction were all statistically significant, R2 = .17, n = 139. The effects of vocabulary and minimal-pair discrimination were both negative, so that higher scores on these measures predicted lower growth curve valleys—that is, a greater maximum probability of fixating on the unfamilar image. For an average participant, a 15-point increase in expressive vocabulary predicted decrease of .03, and an increase of minimal pair accuracy of .1 predicted a decrease in valley of .03. The interaction term, however, was positive, meaning that increasing one of the predictors simulataneously weakens the effect of the other. As one of the predictors increases, it can push the effect of the other closer to zero so that its simple effect is “no longer” statistically significant. In this case, the simple effect of expressive vocabulary was not significant when minimal pair accuracy was .71 or greater (that is, at the 60-percentile or greater). Conversely, the simple effect of minimal pair discrimination accuracy was not significant when expressive vocabulary standard score was 119 or greater (at the 60-percentile or greater). In summary, at age 3, both expressive vocabulary and minimal pair discrimination each predicted greater consideration of the unfamiliar image. But these effects was also redundant so that large changes in one predictor would weaken the effect of the other. The growth curve valley feature measures the maximum extent to which the novel object is considered as the referent on these trials. But the u-shaped growth curves in Figure 11.7 suggest another listening response on this task: Confirmatory looks to the unfamiliar object. In these u-shaped curves, a child’s probability of fixating on the familiar object temporarily decreases as the novel object is considered, and the probability rises as that interpretation is rejected. To quantify this tendency, I computed each child’s growth curve on the probability scale and re-estimated the quadratic trends in these curves. Exploratory visualization showed that children with higher values on this quadratic trend were more likely to have a u-shape curve. This feature, however, also favored sigmoid or z-shaped curves that rapidly fell and plateaued. To avoid these kinds of curves, I weighted the quadratic trend using the median of the final five points of the curve. The weighted quadratic feature penalized curves that have a strong quadratic trend but end on a low probability. Figure 11.9 shows growth curves of age 5 children binned using this feature. The bottom row of panels illustrates how the u-shaped feature becomes stronger in each bin. The weighted quadratic feature was weakly correlated with the growth curve valleys, r = −.12, and the lack of correlation appears in the figure by how the curves in each panel reach different valleys. Figure 11.9: Growth curves for mispronunciations trials starting on the unfamilar object at age 5. Children were grouped into sextiles based on the posterior mean of their curves quadratic trend weighted by the height of the curve in the final time bins. Ten lines are drawn per child to visualize uncertainty. Children were assigned colors arbitrarily. I regressed the u-shaped curve feature onto expressive vocabulary standard score at each age and onto minimal pair discrimination for age 3. There was a tiny yet significant of vocabulary at age 5, R2 = .03, where children with lower vocabularies had a slightly stronger u-shaped trend in their growth curve. This effect, however, is so small as to be negligible. None of the effects were significant. Summary. At age 3, children with larger expressive vocabularies or better minimal pair discrimination had lower growth curve valleys—that is, they looked more to the unfamiliar object when they heard a mispronunciation while fixated on an image of the mispronounced word. These two child-level measures significantly interacted so that increasing both measures simultaneously had diminishing returns. I devised a measure of the how u-shaped the growth curves were, but there were not any meaningful effects of vocabulary or expressive vocabulary on this measure. 11.3 Looking behaviors and word learning At age 5, we tested children’s retention of the novel objects paired with the mispronunciations and nonwords. Children saw the two novel objects and heard either the mispronunciation or the nonword, and they had to point to the objects that went with the image. All six nonwords and mispronunciations were tested. Table 11.1 shows the results for each item. Overall, children performed better on the nonwords than the real words. Children performed decidedly better on the nonwords than the mispronunciations on four of pairs, and performed about equally well on the remaining two (gake-pumm, wice-bape). Table 11.1: Results for the item recognition tests. Word Group Type Item Trials Correct Percent Correct cake mispronunciation gake 61 / 107 57% ± 4.8 nonword pumm 56 / 107 52% ± 4.8 duck mispronunciation guck 71 / 107 66% ± 4.6 nonword shan 97 / 107 91% ± 2.8 girl mispronunciation dirl 71 / 107 66% ± 4.6 nonword naydge 98 / 107 92% ± 2.7 rice mispronunciation wice 79 / 107 74% ± 4.2 nonword bape 80 / 107 75% ± 4.2 shoes mispronunciation sues 60 / 107 56% ± 4.8 nonword geeve 90 / 107 84% ± 3.5 soup mispronunciation shoup 63 / 107 59% ± 4.8 nonword cheem 93 / 107 87% ± 3.3 (all) mispronunciation 405 / 642 63% ± 1.9 nonword 514 / 642 80% ± 1.6 I performed an item-response analysis using a mixed-effects logistic regression model. Appendix D reports the code used to specify the model. The model included varying intercepts for child, child × item type, item, and word-group. The first two effects capture information about a child’s general ability and their ability on each type of item. The second two effects capture information about an item’s difficulty and difficulty of object-pairs. I also asked whether growth curve peaks predicted novel word recognition accuracy, so I included growth curve peaks from each condition in the model. For the nonwords, I used the age-5 peak proportion of looks to the novel image for trials that started on the familiar object. For the mispronunciations, I used the peak looks to the familiar object on trials that started on the unfamiliar object. I chose those peaks based on the conclusion that children were reliably treating the mispronunciations as imperfect productions of the familiar word. The model included data from 101 children. The model confirmed that children were much more successful on the nonword trials. For a child with an average mispronunciation peak (.72), the predicted proportion correct on the mispronunciation retention trials was .64 [.49, .76]. A 1-SD (.19) increase in the mispronunciation peak predicted a change in proportion correct of −.05 [−.10, −.01]. Children who looked more to the familiar object on these mispronunciation trials were less successful during the retention trials. For a child with an average peak on the nonword trials (.90), the predicted proportion correct on the nonword retention trials was .82 [90% UI: .70, .89]. A 1-SD increase (.10 to 1.00) in nonword peaks predicted a change in proportion correct of −.01 [−.05, .02]. The uncertainty interval here includes positive and negative values. It is uncertain whether the effect is positive or negative, so I conclude that there was not a reliable effect in the nonword case. Figure 11.10 visualizes the model results. The difference in height between the two curves reflects the general advantage in the nonword condition. The negative slope for the mispronunciation line captures the effect of growth curve peaks. A change in misprounciation growth curve peak from .5 to 1 roughly predicts a change from 4/6 to 3/6 mispronunciation items correct. The nonword line hovers around 5/6 items correct: There is not enough information in the peaks or in the number of retention trials for a reliable effect to emerge. Figure 11.10: Effect of growth curve peaks on children’s accuracy on retention trials. For the mispronunciations, I used the peak looks to the familiar image on trials where the child started on the unfamilar image, so it represents, say, how much a child looked at shoes given “suze”. Thus, more permissive listeners looked performed more poorly on the retention trials. For the nonwords, I used the peak look to the unfamilar image on trials where the child started on the familiar image. Points were jittered by 1% to avoid overplotting. There were six trials per condition which is why the points fall into 6 bands. Summary. When 5-years-olds were tested on their retention of the unfamiliar images used on the mispronunciations and nonword trials, child were much more accurate for the nonwords than the mispronunciations. Children’s accuracy on the mispronunciations was related to their looking behaviors: Children looked more to the familiar image during mispronunciation trials had a lower accuracy on the mispronunciation retention trials. 11.4 Discussion In the lab, when preschoolers are looking at a novel object and hear the name of a different familiar object, albeit mispronounced, they look to the familiar object. Children do this reliably at age 3 and even more reliably at age 5. Thus, children recognized these mispronunciations as productions of familiar words, but this recognition was not without a penalty. They looked much less to the familiar object under these conditions, compared to trials where they hear a correct production of the familiar object—see Figure 11.11–or when they hear a nonword in a context that supports fast-referent selection. Therefore, preschoolers are unquestionably sensitive to mispronunciations of familiar words so that they show more uncertainty when hearing a mispronunciation. In terms of lexical processing, the mispronounced syllable onset leads them down a phonological garden path. The “d” in dirl activates a neighborhood a d-inital words. The rest of the syllable, however, provides information needed to activate “girl”. Figure XX illustrates these differences. Children therefore are slower to build up activation of the word because the onset-mismatch, and they show less activation overall because the word only matches the rime of the word. They get a late start and have to work with a poor-fitting form of the word. The finding that children are better at processing mispronunciations at age 5 suggests that children are able to build up more activation to these candidate rime words. One complication to the lexical processing interpretation is that this is a two-image task. Children have had to time to view each image before the noun onset. In viewing the images, children can build up an expectations for the words they will hear named. This expectation can build up the resting activation of the word “girl” before it is labeled as “dirl”. Thus, the lexical processing interpretation is not quite as simple as the child building up information from the rest of the word and matching “dirl” to the photo of the girl. Not sure where I am going here… It’s not just the word forms alone but the child’s expectations I guess and those expectations might change or become more efficient with age. This is not as big of a concern for the four-image task because the child hears well-formed words. Child-level measures were not predictive of looking behaviors at age 4 or age 5. Perhaps this is too easy. There is no effect of expressive vocabulary here, especially at older ages. So they are sensitive but they become more accommodating of the mispronounced version. Figure 11.11: Text reference for caption I also analyzed trials where children started on the familiar word and heard a mispronunciation. In this situation, there is no one clear strategy for referent selection, and children exhibit a few different patterns. Some stay put. Some reliably switch to the novel image. Some look at both equally. On average, the growth curve averages rush to .5, which is equal looks to both images, which is maximum uncertainty. At age 5, the curve does not reach quite as far down as the other curves, so they never fall into maximum uncertainty. These sets of analyses mainly demonstrate that when children start on a familiar image and hear a mispronunciation, they have a few options for how to proceed. Child-level predictors only were predictive at age 3 for curve valley. In this case, children with larger vocabularies or better minimal pair discrimination showed more consideration of the nonword object. I speculate that in this situation, the effect reflects that children with better abilities in these areas were more sensitive to the mispronunciation. These children were good at recognizing the mismatch from partial information and thus allocated more credibility to the alternative image. In these analyses, I also defined a weighted quadratic growth curve feature that measured how u-shaped the curves were. I was interested in whether confirmatory looking behaviors were reliably related to child level factors. They were not, outside of neglibly small effect of vocabulary at age 5. This also shows a possible decoupling between lexical processing and referent selection. It is unlikely that children heard the mispronunciations differently in these trials, but rather they responded differently. Not sure where I am going here. None of the child level predictors were related to u-shaped patterns. At age 5, we were able to test children’s retention of the mispronunciations and nonwords. Children were much more likely to recall which unfamiliar object appeared on the nonword trials than the mispronunciation trials. This difference is not unexpected. In the nonword trials, children looked to an unfamiliar object when given an unambiguous novel word for a label. Thus, each trial worked to build an association between a new word and an unfamiliar object. But children treated the mispronunciations as productions of the familiar words. For the unfamiliar-initial trials, they look more to the familiar object, a result that held at all three ages. Rather than developing an object-label mapping, children are working on resolving an ambiguous and uncertain production on these trial. This idea is consistent with the effect of growth curve peaks on retention accuracy: Child who looked less to the unfamiliar object on mispronunciation trials were less likely to recall that unfamiliar object during retention testing. This result here is consistent with Swingley and Aslin (2007) in which toddlers were better able to retain unneighbored nonwords (like shang or meb) compared to neighbored nonwords (i.e., mispronunciations like tog [dog] or gall [ball]). They concluded that part of the fast-referent selection involves a probability calculation in which children “evaluat[e] the likelihood that an utterance conveys a new word”. "],

These three types of stimuli allow us to examine features of children’s representations of familiar words. 12.1 A lexical processing account of the findings In terms of lexical processing, the mispronounced syllable onset leads them down a phonological garden path. The “d” in dirl activates a neighborhood a d-inital words. The rest of the syllable, however, provides information needed to activate “girl”. Figure XX illustrates these differences. Children therefore are slower to build up activation of the word because the onset-mismatch, and they show less activation overall because the word only matches the rime of the word. They get a late start and have to work with a poor-fitting form of the word. The finding that children are better at processing mispronunciations at age 5 suggests that children are able to build up more activation to these candidate rime words.

Thus, the lexical processing interpretation is not as simple as a child building up information from the rest of the word and matching “dirl” to the photo of the girl. 12.2 Limitations and implications Limitations. The biggest limitation to this study is that it applied a procedure designed for toddlers on preschoolers. That is to say, it was too easy for there to be large year-over-year developmental changes in their performance. Children were successful at recognizing real words and fast-selecting referents for nonwords at age 3 and improved a litt Why do children prefer nonwords over familiar words? The most obvious answer would be a novelty effect. Another reason would be that these are unambiguous words. Because of the mispronunciation trials, a child hears familiar words or bad versions of familiar words. It could be that cost of processing or recovering from mispronunciations makes children more cautious or less certain for familiar words. Granted, this is speculation. Whereas for the nonwords, there is no ambiguity. "],
["aim2-h-check.html", "Chapter 13 Hypothesis check (Specific Aim 2)", " Chapter 13 Hypothesis check (Specific Aim 2) Children’s accuracy and efficiency of recognizing real words and fast-associating nonwords will improve each year. Yes and no. There were obvious gains for nonwords from 3 to 4 and from 4 to 5 for real words. There are gains, but not “each year”. One complication here is that many children started to hit ceiling performance by age 4, so there was not much of developmental gradient for these conditions. Performance in real word recognition and fast association of nonwords will be highly correlated, based on the hypothesis that the same process (referent selection) operates in both situations. Yes, there were correlated. But not “highly”. Under the alternative hypothesis, real word recognition and fast referent selection reflect different skills with different developmental trajectories. Thus, if there is any dissociation between recognition of real words and nonwords, it will be observed in younger children. No—not at all. I observed an dissociation between the two conditions, but it worked in the opposite direction and at the older ages. That is, children at age 4 and age 5 demonstrated an apparent nonword advantage. Although these two measures will be correlated, I predict performance in the nonword condition will be a better predict of future vocabulary growth than performance in the real word condition. This hypothesis is based on the idea that fast referent selection is a more relevant skill for learning new words than recognition of known words. Yes, peak looking probabilities for the nonword condition at age 3 predicted expressive vocabulary at age 5, and the real word looking probabilities did not. This size of this effect was rather small. For the mispronunciations, I predict children with larger vocabularies (that is, older children) will be more likely to tolerate a mispronunciation as a production of familiar word compared to children with smaller vocabularies. Yes, older children looked more to the familiar word on average on the mispronunciation trials. Mispronunciations that feature later-mastered sounds (e.g., rice/wice) will be more likely to be associated to novel objects than earlier-mastered sounds (duck/guck). Not answered. I present the item-level results in in Appendix @ref(#aim2-mp-items). I chose not to formally analyze the items because there were only 6 mispronunciations each year, making it too difficult to generalize about different kinds of mispronunciations. Plus, children seemed to not know rice as well as the other familiar words which makes the problem of measuring a mispronunciation penalty more difficult. "],

["a-needle-in-a-self-organizing-haystack.html", "Chapter 15 A needle in a self-organizing haystack", " Chapter 15 A needle in a self-organizing haystack When I give my sales pitch for word recognition research, I sometimes employ a cheeky analogy of a needle in a haystack. Imagine, for the sake of discussion, that the information processing mechanism behind word recognition were just a naïve table search. Think of autocomplete on a phone or search engine text field. Over the course of development, children’s lexicons grow larger in size and yet they get better at recognizing words. Children with larger lexicons have to find a needle in a larger haystack—yet this apparent liability is an advantage. That is why the search analogy is naïve. Children become better at recognizing words as they learn more words because they extract regularities and discover similarities among words and develop more efficient lexical representations. The haystack develops regularity and becomes easier to search. Try to pull out a single needle and a tangled mess of related needles come with it. But there’s a trap here. One promising route to efficient lexical representations is to have children lazily encode lexical information on demand. That’s the idea of holistic or underspecified representations, and it is safe to say that it has been discredited by mispronunciation studies and word recognition studies. So how we take for granted that lexical representations are well specified. How to proceed? Leach and Samuel (2007) make a distinction between lexical configuration and lexical engagement. If we adopt the analogy that the lexicon is a mental dictionary, a word’s configuration is the information found in its dictionary entry: sound, meaning, syntactic roles, and orthography. A word’s engagement is its connection to other words, like competitors or cohorts or semantic relatives. Children’s words are well-configured for the earliest stages of development. "],

The variables ot1, ot2, and ot3 are the polynomial time features, ResearchID identifies children, and Study identifies the age/year of the study. Primary counts the number of looks to the target image at each time bin; Others counts looks to the other three images. cbind(Primary, Others) is used to package both counts together for a logistic regression. library(rstanarm) # Run chains on different cores options(mc.cores = parallel::detectCores()) m &lt;- stan_glmer( cbind(Primary, Others) ~ (ot1 + ot2 + ot3) * Study + (ot1 + ot2 + ot3 | ResearchID/Study), family = binomial, prior = normal(0, 1), prior_intercept = normal(0, 5), prior_covariance = decov(2, 1, 1), data = d_m) # Save the output readr::write_rds(m, &quot;./data/stan_aim1_cubic_model.rds.gz&quot;) The code cbind(Primary, Others) ~ (ot1 + ot2 + ot3) * Study fits a cubic growth curve for each year of the study. It uses R’s formula syntax to regress the looking counts onto an intercept term (implicitly included by default), ot1, ot2, ot3 along with the interactions of the Study variable with the intercept, ot1, ot2, and ot3. The line (ot1 + ot2 + ot3 | ResearchID/Study) describes the random-effect structure of the model with the / indicating that data from each Study is nested within each ResearchID. Thus, for each child, we have a general intercept and general effects for Time1, Time2, and Time3. These child-level effects are further adjusted using Study:ResearchID effects. The effects in each level are allowed to correlate. For example, I would expect that participants with low average looking probabilities (low intercepts) to have flatter growth curves (low Time1 effects), and this relationship would be captured by one of the random-effect correlation terms. Printing the model object reports the point estimates of the model fixed effects and point-estimate correlation matrices for the random effects. print(m, digits = 2) #&gt; stan_glmer #&gt; family: binomial [logit] #&gt; formula: cbind(Primary, Others) ~ (ot1 + ot2 + ot3) * Study + (ot1 + ot2 + #&gt; ot3 | ResearchID/Study) #&gt; observations: 12584 #&gt; ------ #&gt; Median MAD_SD #&gt; (Intercept) -0.47 0.03 #&gt; ot1 1.57 0.06 #&gt; ot2 0.05 0.04 #&gt; ot3 -0.18 0.03 #&gt; StudyTimePoint2 0.41 0.03 #&gt; StudyTimePoint3 0.70 0.04 #&gt; ot1:StudyTimePoint2 0.56 0.08 #&gt; ot1:StudyTimePoint3 1.10 0.08 #&gt; ot2:StudyTimePoint2 -0.16 0.05 #&gt; ot2:StudyTimePoint3 -0.35 0.05 #&gt; ot3:StudyTimePoint2 -0.12 0.04 #&gt; ot3:StudyTimePoint3 -0.21 0.04 #&gt; #&gt; Error terms: #&gt; Groups Name Std.Dev.

These distributions are centered at 0, so negative and positive effects are equally likely. The intercept distribution as a standard deviation of 5, and the coefficients have a standard deviation of around 3. On the log-odds scale, 95% looking to target would be 2.94, so effects of this magnitude are easily accommodated by distributions like Normal(0 [mean], 3 [SD]) and Normal(0, 5). For the random-effect part of the model, I used RStanARM’s decov() prior which simultaneously sets a prior on the variances and correlations of the model’s random effect terms. I used the default prior for the variance terms and applied a weakly informative LKJ(2) prior on the random-effect correlations. Figure B.1 shows samples from the prior distribution of two dummy models fit with the default LKJ(1) prior and the weakly informative LKJ(2) prior used here. Under LKJ(2), extreme correlations are less plausible; the prior shifts the probability mass away from the ±1 boundaries towards the center. The motivation for this kind of prior was regularization: I give the model a small amount of information to nudge it away from extreme, degenerate values.

B.2 Generalized additive models To model the looks to the competitor images, I used generalized additive (mixed) models. The models were fit in R (vers. 3.4.3) using the mgcv R package (vers. 1.8.23; Wood, 2017) with support from tools in the itsadug R package (vers. 2.3; van Rij et al., 2017). I will briefly walk through the code used to fit one of these models in order to articulate the modeling decisions at play. I first convert the categorical variables into the right types, so that the model can fit difference smooths. # Create a Study dummy variabe with Age 4 as the reference level phon_d$S &lt;- factor(phon_d$Study, c(&quot;TimePoint2&quot;, &quot;TimePoint1&quot;, &quot;TimePoint3&quot;)) # Convert the ResearchID into a factor phon_d$R &lt;- as.factor(phon_d$ResearchID) # Convert the Study factor (phon_d$S) into an ordered factor. # This step is needed for the ti model estimate difference smooths. phon_d$S2 &lt;- as.ordered(phon_d$S) contrasts(phon_d$S2) &lt;- &quot;contr.treatment&quot; contrasts(phon_d$S2) I fit the generalized additive model with the code below. The outcome elog is the empirical log-odds of looking to the phonological competitor relative to the unrelated word. library(mgcv) phon_gam &lt;- bam( elog ~ S2 + s(Time) + s(Time, by = S2) + s(Time, R, bs = &quot;fs&quot;, m = 1, k = 5), data = phon_d) # Save the output readr::write_rds(phon_gam, &quot;./data/aim1-phon-random-smooths.rds.gz&quot;) There is just one parametric term: S2. The term computes the average effect of each study with Age 4 serving as the reference condition (and as the model intercept). Next come the smooth terms. s(Time) fits the shape of Time for the reference condition (Age 4). s(Time, by = S2) fits the difference smooths for Age 3 versus Age 4 and Age 5 versus Age 4. s(Time, R, bs = &quot;fs&quot;, m = 1, k = 5) fits a smooth for each participant (R). bs = &quot;fs&quot; means that the model should use a factor smooth (fs) basis (bs)—that is, a “random effect” smooth for each participant. m = 1 changes the smoothness penalty so that the random effects are pulled towards the group average; Winter and Wieling (2016) and Baayen, Rij, Cat, and Wood (2016) suggest using this option. k = 5 means to use 5 knots (k) for the basis function. The other smooths use the default number of knots (10). I used fewer knots for the by-child smooths because of limited data. As a result, these smooths capture by-child variation by making coarse adjustments to study-level growth curves.

The orthogonal polynomial features for Time, they were scaled as in Specific Aim 1, so that the linear feature ranged from −.5 to .5. Under this scaling a unit change in Time1 was equal to change from the start to the end of the analysis window. The model formula used to specify the model with brms is printed below. The variables ot1, ot2, and ot3 are the polynomial time features, ResearchID identifies children, and Condition identifies the experimental condition (either, the nonword or real word condition). Target counts the number of looks to the target image at each time bin; trials() is a flag that tells brms the number of trials for the binomial process. Here, it is the variable Trials, which is equal to the number of looks to target and distractor in each bin. The syntax (1 + ot1 + ot2 + ot3) * Condition specifies a Time x Condition interaction; it says to estimate an intercept and the three time feature effects for each condition. The line (ot1 + ot2 + ot3 | ResearchID/Condition) describes the random-effect structure of the model with the / indicating that data from each Condition is nested within each ResearchID. library(brms) # Fit a hierarchical logistic regression model formula &lt;- bf( Target | trials(Trials) ~ (1 + ot1 + ot2 + ot3) * Condition + (1 + ot1 + ot2 + ot3 | ResearchID/Condition), family = binomial) The priors for the model are described below. The regression effects (class = &quot;b&quot;) have a moderately informative prior of Normal(0, 1). Because most of the action in the growth curves is a sharp rise, the linear time effect ot1 has a slightly wider prior of Normal(0, 2). A weakly informative LKJ(2) prior is put on the random-effect correlations. I review the role of the LKJ prior in Appendix B. A weakly informative prior is put on the random-effect standard deviations Student-t([df] 7, [mean] 0, [sd] 3). The Student-t distribution is like the normal distribution but it provides slightly thicker tails which allow extreme or outlying values. priors &lt;- c( # Population-average intercept set_prior(class = &quot;Intercept&quot;, &quot;normal(0, 1)&quot;), # Population-average slopes set_prior(class = &quot;b&quot;, &quot;normal(0, 1)&quot;), # ... expect somewhat larger range of effects for linear time set_prior(class = &quot;b&quot;, coef = &quot;ot1&quot;, &quot;normal(0, 2)&quot;), # Correlations for random effect terms set_prior(class = &quot;cor&quot;, &quot;lkj(2)&quot;), # Standard deviation of the distribution from # which random-intercepts are drawn set_prior(class = &quot;sd&quot;, &quot;student_t(7, 0, 3)&quot;)) I originally tried a single model containing all three years with corresponding year effects, year × time interactions, and year × condition × time interactions, but this model took 30 hours to run and did not converge. Therefore, I fit separate models for each year of the study using syntax like the following. m_age3 &lt;- brm( formula = formula, data = d_age3, prior = priors, chains = 4, iter = 2000, cores = 4, control = list(adapt_delta = .99)) # Save the output readr::write_rds(m_age3, &quot;age3_mp.rds.gz&quot;) This code fits the model using four sampling chains in parallel over four processing cores. Early attempts at the model produced warnings, so I increased the adapt_delta control option to make the sampling more robust and eliminate the warnings.

D.2 Mispronunication growth curves Like the models above, these ones are Bayesian mixed-effects logistic regression growth curve models fit with brms. I used two separate models, one for unfamilar-initial trials and familiar-initial trials. Each model included data from all three years of the study. The code is essentially the same syntax with a Study variable replacing the Condition variable. library(brms) # Fit a hierarchical logistic regression model formula &lt;- bf( Target | trials(Trials) ~ (1 + ot1 + ot2 + ot3) * Study + (1 + ot1 + ot2 + ot3 | ResearchID/Study), family = binomial) priors &lt;- c( set_prior(class = &quot;Intercept&quot;, &quot;normal(0, 1)&quot;), set_prior(class = &quot;b&quot;, &quot;normal(0, 1)&quot;), set_prior(class = &quot;b&quot;, coef = &quot;ot1&quot;, &quot;normal(0, 2)&quot;), set_prior(class = &quot;cor&quot;, &quot;lkj(2)&quot;), set_prior(class = &quot;sd&quot;, &quot;student_t(7, 0, 2)&quot;)) mp_unfam &lt;- brm( formula = formula, data = d_u, prior = priors, chains = 4, cores = 4, # Run extra iterations to get a higher effective sample size iter = 3000, control = list( adapt_delta = .995, max_treedepth = 15)) # Save the output readr::write_rds(mp_unfam, &quot;./data/aim2-mp-unfam.rds.gz&quot;) mp_fam &lt;- brm( formula = formula, data = d_f, prior = priors, chains = 4, cores = 4, control = list( adapt_delta = .99, max_treedepth = 15)) # Save the output readr::write_rds(mp_fam, &quot;./data/aim2-mp-fam.rds.gz&quot;) The priors for this model are the same, except for a tighter prior on scale/standard deviations for the random effect distributions. The model had difficulty obtaining an effective number of samples for these parameters. Initially, I tried to tell the model to do more work on each sampling step (adapt_delta = .995 and max_treedepth = 15) and run the chains for 50% longer (iter = 3000). These changes did not solve the problem. By using a tighter prior, the model had a smaller search space meaning it could obtain samples more efficiently. The revised prior was still weakly informative. Figure D.1 llustrates the differences in the prior densities—that is, which values are plausible before seeing the data. It also shows posterior densities from the model and how those values are easily enclosed by the prior densities. Figure D.1: Prior densities (left) versus posterior densities (right) for the random-effect standard deviations. I changed the prior to be tighter, so that it favor values up to 7.5. This prior still turned out to be very conservative, given that the posterior samples for these values are all less than 3.

D.3 Item-response analysis for novel word retention This is an item-response analysis carried out using a Bayesian mixed-effects logistic regression model. These models were fit in R (vers. 3.5.0; R Core Team, 2018) with the brms package (vers. 2.3.1; Bürkner, 2017). I used weakly informative priors. The linear model Correct ~ ItemType * c_peak_10 says to estimate the log-odds of answering correctly using on mispronunciations (intercept) using the growth curve peaks (c_peak_10), adjust it for nonwords (ItemType) and for the nonword × peak interaction. The peaks were mean-centered within each type and multiplied by 10 so that the slope represents the effect of change of .1 from the mean peak value. The model includes four random intercepts: general child ability and child × condition ability adjustments (simultaneously requested using 1 | ResearchID/ItemType, i.e., ResearchID levels have ItemType levels nested under / them), plus specific item-level difficulties (1 | Item) and item-pair level difficulties (1 | WordGroup). d &lt;- readr::read_csv(&quot;./data/mp-norming-data.csv.gz&quot;) priors &lt;- c( # Population-average intercept set_prior(class = &quot;Intercept&quot;, &quot;normal(0, 1)&quot;), # Population-average slopes set_prior(class = &quot;b&quot;, &quot;normal(0, 1)&quot;), # Standard deviation of the distribution from # which random-intercepts are drawn set_prior(class = &quot;sd&quot;, &quot;student_t(7, 0, 2)&quot;)) m_norm &lt;- brm( Correct ~ ItemType * c_peak_10 + (1 | ResearchID/ItemType) + (1 | WordGroup) + (1 | Item), prior = priors, family = bernoulli, chains = 4, iter = 2000, cores = 4, control = list(adapt_delta = .99), data = d) readr::write_rds(m_norm, &quot;./data/mp-norming-m2.rds.gz&quot;) Model summary for retention trials at age 5: summary(m_norm, priors = TRUE, prob = .9) #&gt; Family: bernoulli #&gt; Links: mu = logit #&gt; Formula: Correct ~ ItemType * c_peak_10 + (1 | ResearchID/ItemType) + (1 | WordGroup) + (1 | Item) #&gt; Data: d (Number of observations: 1200) #&gt; Samples: 4 chains, each with iter = 2000; warmup = 1000; thin = 1; #&gt; total post-warmup samples = 4000 #&gt; #&gt; Priors: #&gt; b ~ normal(0, 1) #&gt; Intercept ~ normal(0, 1) #&gt; sd ~ student_t(7, 0, 2) #&gt; #&gt; Group-Level Effects: #&gt; ~Item (Number of levels: 12) #&gt; Estimate Est.Error l-90% CI u-90% CI Eff.Sample Rhat #&gt; sd(Intercept) 0.67 0.22 0.37 1.08 1468 1.00 #&gt; #&gt; ~ResearchID (Number of levels: 101) #&gt; Estimate Est.Error l-90% CI u-90% CI Eff.Sample Rhat #&gt; sd(Intercept) 0.34 0.17 0.05 0.62 454 1.01 #&gt; #&gt; ~ResearchID:ItemType (Number of levels: 200) #&gt; Estimate Est.Error l-90% CI u-90% CI Eff.Sample Rhat #&gt; sd(Intercept) 0.47 0.19 0.11 0.76 419 1.00 #&gt; #&gt; ~WordGroup (Number of levels: 6) #&gt; Estimate Est.Error l-90% CI u-90% CI Eff.Sample Rhat #&gt; sd(Intercept) 0.46 0.36 0.05 1.11 1152 1.00 #&gt; #&gt; Population-Level Effects: #&gt; Estimate Est.Error l-90% CI u-90% CI Eff.Sample Rhat #&gt; Intercept 0.57 0.37 -0.03 1.16 1992 1.00 #&gt; ItemTypenonword 0.90 0.40 0.22 1.54 2180 1.00 #&gt; c_peak_10 -0.12 0.06 -0.22 -0.02 4000 1.00 #&gt; ItemTypenonword:c_peak_10 0.04 0.14 -0.20 0.28 4000 1.00 #&gt; #&gt; Samples were drawn using sampling(NUTS).

["aim2-mp-items.html", "E Effects of specific mispronunciations", " E Effects of specific mispronunciations In this section, I briefly discuss item-level differences for the mispronunciation task. I intended to formally analyze and model these effects as part of the main analysis. Prior to beginning this project, I expected that children would show different responses for different real-word–mispronunciation pairs. Not all mispronunciations are equally bad, and in fact, there could be some systematic tendencies in the badness of the mispronunciations. I hypothesized that children would show less of a penalty for later-acquired sounds. What I had in mind in particular was that rice and wice would be more similar than, say, duck and guck and other pairs. The design of this experiment and the data collected, however, are not equipped to address this hypothesis. I came to this conclusion after visualizing the rice versus wice looking data and observing that children looked to rice less than the other real words. Figure E.1 shows the growth curves for real word and mispronunciations. Figure E.1: Average proportion of looks to the familiar object for real words and mispronunciations. A dog/tog pair was administered at age 3 but it was replaced by rice/wice at age 4. Rice and wice are indeed very similar, but children do not know rice very well it seems. In the plot, for instance, age-5 rice has as many looks as age-4 dirl. Given that the data tested only 6 mispronunciations per year, compounded by the fact that some real words are harder than others, I decided that it would not feasible to draw conclusions about different kinds of mispronunciations. A more appropriate study would test many more mispronunciations and vary the familiarity of the paired real words to handle these limitations. It is still informative to plot the differences between the real word and mispronunciation lines, as in Figure E.2. This plot confirms that rice and wice are very similar. One interesting, and somewhat unexpected feature, is how the differences increase with age for some items. Namely, it appears that dirl becomes a worse and worse realization of girl as children grow older. A similar change happens with shoup for soup.

["related-work.html", "F Related work", " F Related work In this section, I clarify relationships between this project and other word recognition research reported from our lab. In short, our lab has reported results about the two-image and four-image experiments from cross-sectional samples, describing child-level measures that predict performance in these tasks. In contrast, my dissertation 1) focuses on the longitudinal development of word recognition and 2) engages with the fine-grained details of lexical processing. Law et al. (2016) analyzed data from the four-image experiment in Specific Aim 1. This study featured a diverse cross-sectional sample of 60 children, half of whom received the experiment in African American English and half received it in Mainstream American English. The sample ranged in age from 28 to 60 months. The study included data from 23 participants from year 1 of the longitudinal study (i.e., what I refer to as age 3) in order to enrich parts of the sample demographics. For this manuscript, we analyzed how vocabulary and maternal education predicted looking patterns, including relative looks to the semantic and phonological foils, but with conventional polynomial growth curves. The use of generalized additive models is an innovation I developed for my dissertation. Law and Edwards (2015) analyzed a different version of the mispronunciation experiment on a different sample of children (n = 34, 30–46 months old). This earlier version included both real word and the mispronunciation of the real word in the same block of trial. For example, a child would hear “dog” and “tog” during the same session of the experiment. This design might subtly temper the effect of mispronounced stimuli by allowing the listener to compare the mispronunciation to its correctly produced counterpart. The version of the experiment in Specific Aim 2 separates the real words and mispronunciations so that a child never hears a familiar word and its mispronunciation during the same block of trials. With this design, there is no explicit point of comparison for the mispronunciation, and the child has to rely on his or her own lexical representations when processing these words. Mahr and Edwards (in press) was the manuscript I originally authored for my preliminary examinations. The paper analyzes the same kinds of relations as Weisleder and Fernald (2013) which showed that lexical processing efficiency mediated the effect of language input on future vocabulary size. Specifically, I asked whether word recognition performance on the four-image task of Specific Aim 1, vocabulary size, and home language input data from year 1 (age 3) predicted vocabulary size at year 2 (age 4). The paper only examined looks to the familiar image from one year of the study, so it did not analyze any lexical competition effects or the development of word recognition within children. In short, we found that receptive vocabulary was more sensitive to variability in lexical processing and home language input than expressive vocabulary. References "],
