  [*draft*] Vocabulary size in preschool is a robust predictor of later language
  development, and early language skills predict early literacy skills at
  school entry. By studying the mechanisms that shape word
  learning, we can understand how individual differences in language
  ability arise and identify strategies for closing language gaps between
  children. Word recognition—the process of mapping incoming speech sounds
  to known or novel words—has been shown to predict later language
  outcomes. We do not know how this ability develops over time, and we do
  not know when word recognition is most predictive of future outcomes.
  This project will provide an integrated account of how word recognition
  develops from age 3 to age 5.
