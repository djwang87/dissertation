# Development of word recognition in preschoolers {-}

This book, when finished, will contain my dissertation research. 

## Updates  {-}

- 2017-08-18: I migrated what I wrote for my dissertation proposal. In 
doing so, I worked all the kinks required to generate a nice 
[web version](https://tjmahr.github.io/dissertation/), a lovely 
[pdf version](https://tjmahr.github.io/dissertation/dissertation.pdf), and 
a... uh... _functional_ 
[Word document version](https://tjmahr.github.io/dissertation/dissertation.docx).
