<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 2</span> General discussion</h1>
<p>In this chapter, I integrate results from the two studies. First, I describe the mechanisms underlying children’s word recognition. I then briefly discuss some clinical implications of this research, and I outline the main contributions of the research.</p>
<div id="mechanisms-of-word-recognition" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Mechanisms of word recognition</h2>
<p>What cognitive or word-recognitions mechanisms can account for the data observed from these two studies? These are the essential findings that the model needs to account for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developmental improvements in familiar word recognition</li>
<li>Early advantage of phonologically similar words (over unrelated words)</li>
<li>Late advantage of semantically similar words (over unrelated words)</li>
<li>Developmental changes in the advantage of these similar words</li>
<li>Disrupted processing of onset-mispronunciations</li>
<li>Easy processing of unambiguous nonwords</li>
<li>Individual differences in familiar word recognition</li>
</ul>
<p>As a baseline for word recognition mechanisms, I would start with 1) a continuous activation model 2) that uses different levels of representation—in other words, TRACE <span class="citation">(McClelland &amp; Elman, <a href="#ref-TRACE">1986</a>)</span>. In my preceding interpretations of the data from Aim 1 and Aim 2 I have assumed a TRACE-like archecture, so it is helpful to briefly review what this model does.</p>
<p>TRACE interprets an input pattern by spreading energy (activation) through a network of processing units. The pattern of activation over the network is its interpretation of the input signal, so that more active units represent more likely interpretations. Over many processing cycles, the network propagates energy among its connections until it settles into a stable pattern of activation. (Activation also decays over cycles so that the model can start and return a resting state.) This activation process is <em>continuous</em>; the model’s interpretation evolves continuously. We can ask at any point during (or after) presentation of a word what the model’s interpretation of that word is. Thus, the listener does not need to hear a whole word to generate a plausible guess for that word <span class="citation">(e.g., Fernald, Swingley, &amp; Pinto, <a href="#ref-Fernald2001">2001</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The model involves three levels of representation: perceptual/phonetic features, phoneme units and lexical units. The input for TRACE is a mock-speech signal that activates the perceptual feature-detectors. These units respond to phonetic features like voicing or vocalic resonance. The perceptual units activate phoneme units, and the phoneme units activate lexical word units. For example, the bundle of features representing a /b/ would activate /b/ but to a lesser extent also activate the phonetically similar /d/ (different place), /p/ (voice), /v/ (manner), or /m/ (nasality). The initial /b/ sound activates a neighborhood of words containing /b/, and the phonetically similar sound also activate matching similar words, albeit to a weaker extent.</p>
<p>The combination of continuous processing and levels of representation means that ambiguities can arise during word recognition. After /b/, the sound /i/ arrives, activating a set of phoneme units and in turn activating words containing /i/. The sequence of /bi/ favors a particular neighborhood of cohorts: <em>be</em>, <em>bee</em>, <em>beam</em>, <em>beak</em>, <em>beat</em>, <em>beetle</em>, etc. At this point, however, the signal is ambiguous. Any of the words in the cohort are plausible interpretations and more information is needed to refine the interpretation. In <span class="citation">Swingley, Pinto, and Fernald (<a href="#ref-Swingley1999">1999</a>)</span>, 24-month-olds were slower to respond to trials of <em>doggie</em> versus <em>doll</em>, compared to <em>doggie</em>–<em>tree</em> or <em>doll</em>–<em>truck</em> trials, where the delay reflected the brief ambiguity from the words sharing an onset and vowel.</p>
<!-- phonological effect -->
<p>The mechanisms described thus far can account for the advantage of the phonological competitors over unrelated words from the first study. The initial phoneme in a word activates a cohort of words that share that sound, so that the cohorts briefly represent more plausible interpretations of the target than words that are not phonologically related. A child can act on that early information and shift their gaze to the phonological competitor.</p>
<p>Words in TRACE compete with each other through lateral inhibition, so that an active word will dampen the activation of other competitors. Inhibition allows the model to reinforce or revise an interpretation. In the earlier example, the arrival of /m/ after /bi/ would strongly favor <em>beam</em> as the most plausible interpretation of the word, and <em>beam</em> will inhibit the other candidates like <em>beak</em> or <em>beat</em> so that it can be the decisive interpreation of the word. The transient effect of the phonological competitor suggests lateral inhibition: The advantage of the phonological competitor over the unrelated word is short-lived because the target word builds up activation and inhibits the phonological competitor.</p>
<!-- semantic effect and cascading activation -->
<p>To account for the effect of the semantic competitor, we need to make a few more assumptions. Semantic information is not explicitly included as a part of TRACE but we can stipulate that semantic information is part of a word’s lexical representation. We also need a way for semantically related words to co-activate, so that hearing <em>bee</em> will generate some spurious looks to <em>fly</em>. In this case, we can assume that there are excitatory connections between semantically related words, so that hearing a word also activates its semantic relatives. In my earlier discussions, I used the term <em>cascading activation</em> to describe this arrangement. For children to generate looks to the semantic competitor, they first to need to build up activation of the word and that activation would cascade over to semantic relatives. The time course of activation here is consistent with the late effects of the semantic competitor. The semantic competitor can exerts an advantage over the unrelated word after semantic information comes online.</p>
<p>The relative advantage of the phonological and semantic competitors increased each year, as did children’s overall recognition of the familiar word. In other words, children became better at activating the target and the words related to the target. In Chapter XX, I argued that these developmental changes in the first study reflected stronger phoneme–word connections (for greater activation of the target and phonological competitors) and stronger semantic connections between words. I did not observe any developmental changes in inhibition, so I favored an interpretation that focused on stronger connections.</p>
<!-- mispronunciations -->
<p>One prediction of TRACE is that rhymes and rimes (one-syllable rhymes) can affect word recognition. But these rhymes are at a disadvantage. Early in the processing of a word, all of the action is in the bottom-up connections from the phonetic features to the phonological units onto the words. Cohorts show an early advantage in word recognition because they receive activation before lexical units start to inhibit each other. The rhyme mismatch the input from the start of the word, so they undergo inhibition early on. But as the word unfolds, subsequent phonemes can build up activation of the rhyme word and the word can overcome the initial disadvantage. <span class="citation">Allopenna, Magnuson, and Tanenhaus (<a href="#ref-Allopenna1998">1998</a>)</span> found similarity between TRACE activation patterns and adult listeners’ looking pattern. Namely, adults hear <em>beaker</em> and look to the word, but they also generate spurious early looks to a cohort <em>beetle</em> and late looks to a rhyme <em>speaker</em>. (Anecdotally, my name is Tristan, but in grade school, I always snapped to attention whenever Kristen’s name was called.)</p>
<p>The mechanisms that predict how rhymes can engage in the lexical competition also explain the disruptive mispronunciation effects. An initial <em>s</em> in <em>suze</em> sends the listener down a lexical garden path, activating /s/-initial words. The arrival of the rest of the word, <em>shoes</em>, plus the image of the shoes onscreen, supports <em>shoes</em> as an interpretation of the word. But there is much less certainty in this situation. At age 3, we observed 50% looking for <em>suze</em> and 80% looking for <em>shoes</em>. There was a small developmental improvement for mispronunciation conditions and the real word condition. For example, at age 5, <em>suze</em> reaches 60% looking and <em>shoes</em> reaches 87% looking. Developmentally, children became more likely to activation the target when given a mispronunciation, and this change reflects like general improvements in activation efficiency.</p>
<p>Footnote? It should be noted that these mispronunciations were all one-syllable words, so they did not have phonological substance that could overlap with the target. If the mispronunciation-target pairs were longer like a <em>beaker</em>–<em>speaker</em> rhyme, we would predict more segments would overlap, leading to greater activation of the mispronounced target.</p>
<!-- nonwords -->
<p>What about the effortless processing of the unambiguous nonwords? Surely, children do not have a lexical item <em>geeve</em> to activate the first time they hear the word. (Perhaps not.) On these trials, however, the children did know <em>sock</em> and know that <em>geeve</em> was not the name for the sock, so they looked to the trolley instead. For <span class="citation">McMurray, Horst, and Samuelson (<a href="#ref-McMurray2012">2012</a>)</span>, the problem facing a child is reference selection: Children have to select a visual referent for a spoken word. In that model, all words can refer to all visual referents initially and the model has to prune away unnecessary connections to build up selective word recognition. Development of the <em>sock</em>-sock pairing pruned away other visual referents or words from activating <em>sock</em>. Thus, “geeve” is not likely to activate <em>sock</em> so the viability of the <em>geeve</em>-trolley pairing allow the child to select the correct referent for the nonword. In TRACE simulations, <span class="citation">Mayor and Plunkett (<a href="#ref-TRACE_Mispro">2014</a>)</span> simulated this situation by treating the nonword as a low-frequency word. In both of these situations, the novel nonword is recognized because it is not affected by lexical competition from any other plausible alternatives.</p>
<p>This framework also allows us to account for the differences in retention for the nonwords and mispronunciations at age 5. In <span class="citation">McMurray et al. (<a href="#ref-McMurray2012">2012</a>)</span>, learning was associative. Developed connections between spoken words, lexical items, and visual referents when spoken words and visual referents occurred together, and each co-occurence build up the connections. On the mispronunciation trial from the second study, a child heard a mispronunciation of a familiar word and also saw an image of mispronounced word. On average, they tended to interpret the mispronunciation as the familiar word. Thus, the familar word competed with the mispronunciation, leading the child to develop a weaker association between the novel object and mispronunciation. The effect of looking behavior, where children who looked more to the familiar image on mispronunciation trials showed poor retention, shows how the familiar image could impede the association of the mispronunciation and the novel objet. In contrast, for unambiguous nonword trials, children could associate the novel object and novel word more strongly. This difference in lexical competition manifested in the retention performance where children demonstrated that children were better able to retain nonwords than mispronunciations.</p>
<!-- individual differences -->
<p>So far, I have described a general framework of word recognition and I claimed children’s developmental changes in word recognition reflect more efficient representations and activation pathways. I now describe task differences and individual differences under this framework.</p>
<p>Word learning is a matter of degree. I like to draw a distinction between “shallow” receptive knowledge and “deeper” expressive knowledge, based on the idea that recognition is easier than generation. But we can imagine an even finer continuum with degrees of recognition ability. For example, a word can be recognized in one situation but may not be recognized in a more challenging situation. For example, <span class="citation">McMurray et al. (<a href="#ref-McMurray2012">2012</a>)</span> tested a word-learning model’s comprehension by simulating alternative-forced choice (AFC) tasks where a target was pitted against competitors. The model showed graded performance, with better comprehension on a 3-AFC (2 competitor) tests than 5-AFC tests, and better performance on 5-AFC tests than 10-AFC tests. Thus, the 4-AFC task in my first study provided a more challenging word-recognition than the 2-AFC task in the second study. For example, children demonstrated ceiling performance on the nonword condition at age 4, whereas children had room to develop each year in the 4-AFC task.</p>
<p>Individual differences in word recognition reflect differences in children’s lexicons and their representations. Although all the words on the 4-AFC were familiar to children, children differed in their peak looking probabilities and rate of fixating on the target. In lexical processing terms, children differed in their peak activation and the rate at which activation reached the target word. Differences in word recognition were stable from year to year. Even though all of the children became faster, more reliable and more certain during word recognition with age, the children who faster and more reliable at age 3 were also faster and more reliable at age 5. The children who performed better at age 3 had more experience and more reliable representations of the words—thus, they had a head start and they built on top of that advantage. This interpretation can also account for how word recognition performance at age 3 correlated with vocabulary scores at later ages.</p>
</div>
<div id="open-questions-about-word-recognition-mechanisms" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> ### Open questions about word recognition mechanisms</h2>
<p>There are three open questions from this research. First, how does lexical inhibition change over this developmental window? The results from the first study show that phonologically and semantically similar words become more relevant during word recognition as children grow older. Thus, the words became more active, compared to the unrelated word. I did not observe any clear changes in how quickly those words are <em>rejected</em> as possible interpretations of the input, and thus, I could not make any claims about the development of inhibition.</p>
<p>Based on other work, we could expect older children to show greater inhibition. <span class="citation">Rigler et al. (<a href="#ref-Rigler2015">2015</a>)</span> showed that 9-year-old children were more sensitive to phonological cohorts and rimes than 16-year-old children, suggesting children need to develop inhibitory connections that suppress the interference from these words. Blomquist and McMurray (in prep.) used a cross-splicing paradigm to test lexical inhibition in 7–8- versus 12–13-year-old children. In this paradigm, a target like <em>cap</em> is created by splicing initial <em>ca</em> onset with a different tokne (ca(p)p), with a cohort competitor (ca(t)p) and a nonword (ca(k)p), the idea being that the cohort splice will favor <em>cat</em> and inhibit <em>cap</em> whereas a nonword splice cannot inhibit <em>cap</em>. This manipulation held in both groups but the older children were more disrupted by the cohort splice. It would revealing to see both paradigms applied to this age range. For the preschool years, however, the trajectory seems to be the development of connections so that the phonological competitors can participate in word recognition with later childhood being a time to develop inhibitory connections. In other words, a child has to develop sensitivity to cohorts first in order to demonstrate the ability to quickly inhibit them.</p>
<p>A second open question is when does a nonword start to interfere with word recognition in children at this age. For adults, nonwords can affect processing very quickly. <span class="citation">Kapnoula, Packard, Gupta, and McMurray (<a href="#ref-Kapnoula2015">2015</a>)</span> used a cross-splicing paradigm and observed that in adults, newly learned words compete with familiar ones immediately. <span class="citation">Magnuson, Tanenhaus, Aslin, and Dahan (<a href="#ref-Magnuson2003">2003</a>)</span> trained adult participants with artificial lexicons and observed that after one day of training, cohort and rimes effects <em>within the artificial lexicon</em> were comparable, but after a second day, the cohort showed an early advantage. For preschool-age children, I would expect children to learn show cohort and rime effects, but sensitivity to cross-splicing is an open question.</p>
<p>A third open question, given the previous discussion of models and mechanisms, is whether a word recognition model like TRACE can replicate the developmental changes observed here. There is no reason to assume that it would not be able to simulate the results from each year, given that it has been used to simulate word-recognition data from adults <span class="citation">(Allopenna et al., <a href="#ref-Allopenna1998">1998</a>)</span>, adults with aphasia <span class="citation">(Mirman, Yee, Blumstein, &amp; Magnuson, <a href="#ref-Mirman2011">2011</a>)</span>, toddlers <span class="citation">(Mayor &amp; Plunkett, <a href="#ref-TRACE_Mispro">2014</a>)</span>, and adolescents with specific language impairment <span class="citation">(McMurray, Samelson, Lee, &amp; Tomblin, <a href="#ref-McMurray2010">2010</a>)</span>. Of interest will be the developmental story: Which parameters would need to change each year to have the model match the empirical data? I would posit that the model would to use some combination of changing the rate of lexical activation and changing the strength of lexical inhibition to match these developmental changes.</p>
</div>
<div id="clinical-implications" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Clinical implications</h2>
<p>The results of the first study remind us that words are not simply acquired—they are learned and <em>integrated</em>. In the first study, children’s recognition of very familiar words improved each year. Children’s representations of familiar words continue to develop, even if they ostensibly <em>know</em> the word. One might attribute this development change to improvements in visual processing and sensory processing or some other nonlinguistic factor. This study cannot rule out those explanations. The increasing effect of the phonological and semantic competitors, however, suggests that changes in lexical representations can explain these results.</p>
<p>Part of the promise of early eyetracking based research is that word recognition can predict later outcomes. One common conclusion in this research is that word recognition may provide an early screening tool: “[t]ime-course measures of comprehension in very young language learners could ultimately prove useful in improving early identification of children at risk for persistent language disorders” <span class="citation">(Fernald &amp; Marchman, <a href="#ref-Fernald2012">2012</a>, p. 219)</span>. The developmental results here stress that such a tool has to be developmentally appropriate. Children’s processing of real words on the two-image task did not predict language outcomes, but the slightly more challenging nonword condition did yield a small predictive effect. For the more difficult four-image task, individual differences were greatest and most predictive at age 3 and the range of variability decreased with age. Thus, word recognition is perhaps best understood as a lexical measure so it needs to be scaled with children’s vocabulary norms.</p>
<p>Finally, the observed difficulty of retaining mispronunciations emphasizes that children will err on the side of known words during nonword referent selection when the known words are plausible interpretations. In particular, it does not seem like a contrastive method of teaching, say, <em>pear</em> by having competing against a known word <em>bear</em> would be effective because the known word would interfere with the encoding of the nonword.</p>
<!-- The TRACE model of speech perception and word recognition [@TRACE] is well suited for this kind of simulation work. TRACE can simulate a dozen or so empirical results from speech perception literature (Strauss, Harris, & Magnuson, 2007, Table 1), and it has been used to simulate word-recognition data from adults (Allopenna, Magnuson, & Tanenhaus, 1998), and adults with aphasia (Mirman, Yee, Blumstein, & Magnuson, 2011), and toddlers (Mayor & Plunkett, 2014).  -->
<!-- @jTRACE -->
<!-- McMurray, Samelson, Lee, and Bruce Tomblin (2010) used TRACE to simulate word recognition results from adolescents with specific language impairment (SLI). They mapped certain theories about SLI onto different model parameters. For example, to test the theory that listeners with SLI have impairments in acoustic perception, they varied three of the model’s parameters: amount of noise added to the model’s mock-speech input, temporal spread of acoustic features in the input (temporal resolution), and rate of decay in the model’s acoustic feature detectors (perceptual memory). Other theories of SLI (and other model parameters) provided a closer fit to the observed data than the perceptual deficit theory. Specifically, lexical decay—“the ability to maintain words in memory” (p. 23)—was the most important model parameter, implying that individual differences in word recognition for listeners with SLI are rooted in lexical processes (and not perceptual or phonological ones).  -->
<!-- This example shows how simulations with TRACE recast word recognition performance in terms of psychological processes. For this project, I will use TRACE to describe how cognitive processes and representations need to change to simulate the development of word recognition in preschoolers. -->
<!-- For a recent example, XXX found that reaction time on a 2-AFC word recognition task at 18-months predicted vocabulary and non-verbal language outcomes at 54 months in children born preterm.  -->
</div>
<div id="contributions" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Contributions</h2>
<p>The most important contribution of this research is that children became more sensitive to phonological and semantic competitors as they grew older. When they erred, they were more likely to look to a relevant word. This result indicates that children improve in word recognition by being able to activate phonological plausible words quickly, from partial information, and activate semantically related words on the basis of cascading activation. The developmental trend is that of more <em>engagement</em> (<span class="citation">Leach and Samuel (<a href="#ref-Leach2007">2007</a>)</span>), with children developing the connections among related words and harnessing those similarities to their advantage.</p>
<p>Another contribution is the description of individual differences in word recognition: Namely, differences are stable over time but diminish in magnitude, so that early differences are more predictive than later ones. Although there was ample evidence of how word recognition predicted later outcomes, it was not clear whether those differences held over the preschool years. The results here indicate that the differences are task-specific: A more age-appropriate four-image task could better differentiate children than a simpler two-image one.</p>
<p>A final contribution is that children generally master mutual-exclusivity-type referent selection by age 4. Children can effortless map nonwords to novel objects, provided that the nonword is not under competition from any known words, as was observed for the mispronunciations.</p>
<!-- Part of the puzzle of word recognition is that children improve in word -->
<!-- recognition despite learning more and more words, thus having more -->
<!-- possibilities to consider during word recognition. How might learning -->
<!-- more words make word recognition search problem even easier? On the -->
<!-- basis of the two studies in this project, I think the distinction by -->
<!-- @Leach2007 between *lexical configuration* and *lexical engagement* is -->
<!-- crucial. If we adopt the analogy that the lexicon is a mental -->
<!-- dictionary, a word's configuration is the information found in its -->
<!-- dictionary entry: sound, meaning, syntactic roles, and orthography. A -->
<!-- word's engagement is its connection to other words, like competitors or -->
<!-- cohorts or semantic relatives.  -->
<!-- This work argues that what children develop and what turns an increase -->
<!-- in words into an advantage is lexical engagement. Children become more -->
<!-- sensitive to phonological and semantic competitors as they grow older, -->
<!-- and  -->
<!-- A needle in a self-organizing haystack -->
<!-- ======================================================================= -->
<!-- When I give my "elevator pitch" for word recognition research, I -->
<!-- sometimes employ a cheeky analogy of a needle in a haystack. Imagine, -->
<!-- for the sake of discussion, that the information processing mechanism -->
<!-- behind word recognition were just a naïve table search. Think of -->
<!-- autocomplete on a phone or a spellchecker. Over the course of -->
<!-- development, children's lexicons grow larger in size and yet they get -->
<!-- *better* at recognizing words. Children with larger lexicons have to -->
<!-- find a needle in a larger haystack—yet this apparent liability is an -->
<!-- advantage. That is why the search analogy is naïve. Children become -->
<!-- better at recognizing words as they learn more words because they -->
<!-- extract regularities and discover similarities among words and develop -->
<!-- more efficient lexical representations. The haystack develops regularity -->
<!-- and becomes easier to search. In fact, try to pull out a single needle -->
<!-- and a tangle of other very similar needles come with it. -->
<!-- The vagueness of the phrase "more efficient lexical representations" is -->
<!-- something of a trap. For example, we might think like the one efficient -->
<!-- way to store lexical items is to posit that children lazily encode -->
<!-- lexical information on demand. That *underspecification* hypothesis has -->
<!-- been discredited by children's sensitivities to mispronunciations and -->
<!-- with their ability to use part-word information during word recognition. -->
<!-- <!-- Let us take for granted that children know the words they know in full -->
<p>–&gt; <!-- <!-- phonetic detail. How might learning more words make word recognition --> –&gt; <!-- <!-- search problem even easier? On the basis of the two studies in this --> –&gt; <!-- <!-- project, I think the distinction by @Leach2007 between *lexical --> –&gt; <!-- <!-- configuration* and *lexical engagement* is crucial. If we adopt the --> –&gt; <!-- <!-- analogy that the lexicon is a mental dictionary, a word's configuration --> –&gt; <!-- <!-- is the information found in its dictionary entry: sound, meaning, --> –&gt; <!-- <!-- syntactic roles, and orthography. A word's engagement is its connection --> –&gt; <!-- <!-- to other words, like competitors or cohorts or semantic relatives. We --> –&gt; <!-- <!-- know from the research into representations that a word's phonetic --> –&gt; <!-- <!-- configuration should be generally well-specified. What children develop --> –&gt; <!-- <!-- and what turns an increase in words into an advantage is lexical --> –&gt; <!-- <!-- engagement. The development of word recognition for preschoolers is --> –&gt; <!-- <!-- about engagement, children learning the connections among related words --> –&gt; <!-- <!-- and harnessing those similarities to their advantage. --> –&gt;</p>
<!-- <!-- Mechanisms -->
<p>–&gt; <!-- <!--   - Start with a baseline of lexical processing: Continuous, incremental activation of candidates and cascading activation to related words. --> –&gt; <!-- <!--   - Become more sensitive to similar words --> –&gt; <!-- <!--       ○ More lexical engagement --> –&gt; <!-- <!--   - Referent selection --> –&gt; <!-- <!--   - Known words --> –&gt; <!-- <!--   - Why does early differences matter? --> –&gt; <!-- <!--       ○ Differences in associative representations (later learning is refinement) are greatest early on. --> –&gt; <!-- <!--       ○ Specify that we are talkinga bout familiarity with these words --> –&gt;</p>
<!-- <!-- Implications -->
<p>–&gt;</p>
<!-- <!--   - Aim 1 -->
<p>–&gt; <!-- <!--       ○ Children do not stop learning words. --> –&gt; <!-- <!--           § It's linguistic because of the foils. --> –&gt; <!-- <!--           § Representations of highly familiar words continue to develop. --> –&gt; <!-- <!--       ○ Continue to develop during preschool years. --> –&gt; <!-- <!--       ○ Everyone gets faster. --> –&gt; <!-- <!--       ○ Early differences matter more than later ones. --> –&gt; <!-- <!--   - Aim 2 --> –&gt; <!-- <!--       ○ Mastery of referent selection in a two-image format by age 4 --> –&gt; <!-- <!--       ○ Still sensitive to mispronunciations --> –&gt; <!-- <!--           § Early penalty from mismatching information --> –&gt; <!-- <!--           § This si like a rime effect or the inverse of cohort effect --> –&gt; <!-- <!--           § Age 5 more like to treat the mispronunciation as a real word. --> –&gt; <!-- <!--           § Take advantage of rest of syllable, better at using rest of word. --> –&gt;</p>
<!-- <!--       ○ Poorer retention of mispronunciations as new words than nonwords -->
<p>–&gt; <!-- <!--       ○ New words that sound like known words and are presented in contexts with the known word are really hard to passively learn. --> –&gt; <!-- <!--           § Known words interfere. --> –&gt;</p>
<!-- <!-- Next steps -->
<p>–&gt; <!-- <!-- CI users and SLI users --> –&gt;</p>
