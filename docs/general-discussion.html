<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 8</span> General Discussion</h1>
<p>This study examined the development of familiar word recognition over the preschool years. The word recognition data came from a visual-world eyetracking experiment which recorded children’s fixations to images in response to prompts like <em>see the bear</em>. The trials featured a target noun along with a phonological competitor, a semantic competitor, and an unrelated image. To describe children’s word recognition ability, I analyzed how the probability of fixating on the target image changed over the time course of a trial. The presence of the competitor images also allowed additional analyses about children’s sensitivities to the phonological and semantic competitors. The experiment was conducted as part of a three-year longitudinal study; children were 28–39 months-old at the Age 3 visit, 39–52 at Age 4, and 51–65 at Age 5. The longitudinal design allowed me to describe developmental changes in word recognition.</p>
<div id="how-to-improve-word-recognition" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.1</span> How to improve word recognition</h2>
<p>Children showed year-over-year improvements in word recognition, as measured by average looking probabilities, peak looking probabilities, and the rate of change in looking probabilities. Children became faster, more reliable, and less uncertain during recognizing familar words. At the same time, children also became more sensitive to the phonological and semantic competitors. With each year, children looked more to the target image, but when they erred, they were more likely to err on a lexical relevant word.</p>
<p>These developmental patterns can be interpreted in terms of lexical activation and processing dynamics. In this task, children hear a stream of speech and activate some phonetic, phonemic, lexical, and semantic representations that match the speech input. As they hear more of a word, the activation builds until a particular word is favored, and children shift their gaze onto the named image. Let’s imagine that we have to engineer this system. To make word recognition more efficient, we have to find ways to increase the relative activation of the correct word. In particular, we can increase the strength of connections so that activation can propagate more quickly through the system, and we can allow inhibit among competing words so that the correct word can win out over its competitors more quickly.</p>
<p>The results from these studies indicate that children become more efficient at activating the target word <em>and related words</em> over the preschool years. As they grew older, children were faster to look at a named image and more likely to fixate on the phonological competitor (compared to the unrelated image). These two findings reflect changes in how (partial) acoustic information can propagate to activate phonologically plausible words. The phonological competitors shared the same syllable onset as the target noun (e.g., <em>dress</em>–<em>drum</em>), so the early part of the word matched both of these words. That children became more sensitive to the phonological competitor with age means that they learned the phonological similarities among words, because part of a word activated a neighborhood of phonological plausible matches. This developmental change supports faster word recognition because the listener can channel activation to relevant words more quickly.</p>
<p>The other mechanism we might tune to improve word recognition is inhibition. Children’s looks to the phonological or semantic competitors were temporary: Looks increase to some peak level and then quickly decrease. Behaviorally, the drop in looking probability reflects the rejection of an interpretation: for example, a child hears “dr”, shifts looks to <em>dress</em>, but hears “um”, revises the interpretation and jumps to <em>drum</em>. We can interpret these corrections as evidence for an inhibitory process: Corrections indicate a change in relative activation where a different word overrides an initial interpretation. But the evidence for <em>developmental changes</em> in lexical inhibition from these data was scant. The rate of rejection of the phonological competitor—that is, how quickly looks fall from their peak value—did not change from age 4 to age 5, although the rate did increase for the semantic competitor from age 4 to age 5. Preschoolers did demonstrate inhibition by revising their interpretations of nouns, but there were no clear developmental changes in inhibition.</p>
<p>Previous simulation work can help us identify more specific mechanisms at play. <span class="citation">McMurray, Samelson, Lee, &amp; Tomblin (<a href="#ref-McMurray2010">2010</a>)</span> used the TRACE model of word recognition <span class="citation">(McClelland &amp; Elman, <a href="#ref-TRACE">1986</a>)</span> to simulate looks to a target and phonological (cohort and rime) competitors in adolescents with specific language impairment. The authors tuned a number of model parameters and examined how those changed influenced predicted looks to the target and competitors. In our dataset, we observed a developmental trend where the relative looks to the phonological competitors peak higher each year. In those TRACE simulations, looks to the cohort competitor peak higher if 1) the rate of lexical activation increased, 2) the rate of lexical decay decreased, or 3) strength of lexical inhibition decreased. Of these options, the decrease in lexical inhibition best matches the current data. The similarity does not mean that children inhibited words less as they grew older. That is too simplistic: The developmental changes in preschoolers are the result of simultaneous changes in many mechanisms. But the similarity here does suggest that the preschoolers certainly did not <em>increase</em> their lexical inhibition with age.</p>
</div>
<div id="learn-words-and-learn-connections-between-words" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.2</span> Learn words and learn connections between words</h2>
<p>Preschoolers showed increased activation of the target noun and semantically and phonologically related words but little developmental change in lexical inhibition. Paired with the findings from older children, these results lead to a compelling developmental story. <span class="citation">Rigler et al. (<a href="#ref-Rigler2015">2015</a>)</span> compared 9- and 16-year-olds on a visual-world word recognition experiment with phonologial (cohort and rime) competitors. The younger children were slower to look to the target image and showed more looks to the competitors. The implications are that children’s word recognition is still developing in late childhood and that in particular, children’s inhibition of lexical competitors became stronger with age.</p>
<p>The current study with 3-, 4-, and 5-year-olds followed a different pattern: Relative looks to the competitor images increased with age. Taken together, these two studies suggest an interesting progression for the development of lexical processing. During the preschool years, children learn many, many words, and they establish phonological and semantic connections between words. These connections support the immediate activation of neighborhoods of words. Late childhood, based on the <span class="citation">Rigler et al. (<a href="#ref-Rigler2015">2015</a>)</span> findings, then is a time for refinement of those connections, so that sensitivity to the competitors decreases. This refinement could follow from more selective activation channels, increased lexical inhibition, or likely a combination of both.</p>
</div>
<div id="individual-differences" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.3</span> Individual differences</h2>
<p>Another dimension of this study concerned individual differences in word recognition. Some children were faster or more accurate during word recognition, and these children were more likely to faster or more accurate at later ages. The magnitude of these differences diminished over time, so that children approached a more mature level of performance.</p>
<p>In terms of lexical processing dynamics, we might think of early differences as reflecting early differences in the burgeoning lexicon. Children may have different numbers of words, different degrees of experience with some words, less established connections among words, and at a lower level, different phonetic and speech perception abilities, given the links between speech perception in infancy and early vocabulary development. Differences in word recognition are greatest early on in development because this is when the differences among children’s lexicons is greatest. The task of learning new words, and more importantly, of developing representations and associations to organize words normalizes the differences among children’s lexicons.<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> That pressure would make the overall variability among children decrease over time while still preserving a relative ordering among children.</p>
<p>We can also interpret the predictive power of word recognition measures in terms of lexical processing and lexical organization. Correlations between word recognition performance and future vocabulary were strongest for the age-3 growth curve features, in particular for the peak probability of looking to the target word. The peak probability measures the overall certainty in word recognition and how strongly the target word is activated. Children with more efficient representations of familiar words at age 3 have a stronger foundation for encoding and integrating future words, and as a result, they showed larger vocabularies at age 4 and age 5.</p>
<p>Initially, I had expected processing <em>speed</em> (that is, growth curve slopes) to be the most predictive measure of vocabulary growth. Children who can more quickly recognize words, the reasoning goes, can take in information more quickly and devote extra processing cycles towards learning.<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Indeed, processing speed was highly correlated with future vocabulary size. Yet peak probability was the strongest predictor of future vocabulary size, although these two processing measures are highly related. (To hit a higher peak at time <em>x</em>, a growth curve needs to start from higher baseline or have steeper slope.)</p>
<p>Children who are better at word recognition also</p>
<p>These findings have implications for our understanding of word learning and word recognition. Children become better at recognizing words by learning similarities among words and using those similarities to activate neighborhoods of lexically relevant words. Rather than just measuring vocabulary size, word recognition reflects how well words have been integrated into the lexicon.</p>
<p>The first is that individual differences in word recognition diminish over time, and the differences are more predictive and discriminating at younger ages.</p>
<p>…limitations</p>
<p>This research has some limitations. The experimental design included semantic and phonological competitors on every trial, so isolating out the semantic and phonological competition effects required some subtlety. A more direct design would compare different types of a trials: for example, a target vs. three unrelated images condition, and a target vs. a competitor vs. two unrelated images condition. The trials also used different kinds of semantic and phonological competitors. For example, two of the phonological competitors rhymed with the target, so they could not be included the analysis of phonological competitors (which focused competitors with the same onset as the target). The current design limited the number of trials that could be used in the analyses of the competitors and weakened the power of the analyses.</p>
<p>Another limitation include changes in the experiment procedure over the course of the longitudinal study. From age 3 to age 4, we re-recorded the stimuli (with the same original speakers) so that the durations between the two different dialect versions of the experiment were similar. From age 4 to age 5, we also shortened the duration of the trials by removing attention-getting prompt (e.g, <em>this is fun!</em>) from the ends of the trials. These small procedural changes mean that year-to-year differences do not reflect <em>pure</em> development differences. It is very implausible, however, that the robust year-over-changes owe more to procedural changes than a year of learning and language development.</p>
