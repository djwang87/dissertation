Items used in the visual world experiment {#vw-experiment-items}
========================================================================







Table \@ref(tab:aim1-all-items) lists the items used for the visual world
experiment. Each row of the table represents a set of four images used
in a trial. There were two blocks of trials with different images and
trial orderings. For the two unrelated foils with more than one word
listed, the two foils were used in different blocks.

For the analysis of phonological competitors, I only used trials where
the target and the phonological foil shared the same syllable onset
(Table \@ref(tab:phonological-competitor-items)). For the analysis of
semantic competitors, I only used trials where the target and the
semantic foil belonged to the same category 
(Table \@ref(tab:semantic-competitor-items)).
