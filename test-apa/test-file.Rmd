A related complication is the apparent predictive validity of word
recognition measures. @MarchmanFernald2008 found that vocabulary size
and lexical processing efficiency at age 2 jointly predicted working
memory scores and expressive language scores at age 8. This result would
suggest domain-general processing advantages influence word learning.
@Fernald2012 also found that late talkers who looked more quickly to a
named word at 18 months showed larger gains in vocabulary by 30 months
compared to late-talkers who looked more slowly at 18 months.
@Weisleder2013 found that lexical processing and language input at 19
months predict vocabulary size at 25 months and that lexical processing
mediated the effect of language input.

Another avenue for studying word recognition is to examine how listeners
respond to unfamiliar or novel stimuli. A productive line of research
has found that children are sensitive to mispronunciations during word
recognition [e.g., @Swingley2000; @Swingley2002]. @WhiteMorgan2008
presented toddlers with images of a familiar and novel object, and
children heard a correct production of the familiar object,
mispronunciations of the familiar object of varying severity, or an
unrelated nonword. Toddlers looked less to a familiar word when the
first segment was mispronounced. Moreover, they demonstrated graded
sensitivity such that a 1-feature mispronunciation yielded more looks to
an image than a 2-feature mispronunciation, and a 2-feature
mispronunciation yielded more looks than a 3-feature one. Finally, in
the nonword condition, the children looked more to the novel object than
the familiar one, demonstrating *fast referent selection* as they
associated novel words to novel objects in the moment. A similar pattern
of effects was observed in the mispronunciation study by @MPPaper with
preschoolers mapping real words to familiar objects, nonwords to novel
objects, and equivocating about mispronunciations of familiar words.
