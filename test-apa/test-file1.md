A related complication is the apparent predictive validity of word
recognition measures. Marchman and Fernald (2008) found that vocabulary
size and lexical processing efficiency at age 2 jointly predicted
working memory scores and expressive language scores at age 8. This
result would suggest domain-general processing advantages influence word
learning. Fernald and Marchman (2012) also found that late talkers who
looked more quickly to a named word at 18 months showed larger gains in
vocabulary by 30 months compared to late-talkers who looked more slowly
at 18 months. Weisleder and Fernald (2013) found that lexical processing
and language input at 19 months predict vocabulary size at 25 months and
that lexical processing mediated the effect of language input.

Another avenue for studying word recognition is to examine how listeners
respond to unfamiliar or novel stimuli. A productive line of research
has found that children are sensitive to mispronunciations during word
recognition (e.g., Swingley & Aslin, 2000, 2002). White and Morgan
(2008) presented toddlers with images of a familiar and novel object,
and children heard a correct production of the familiar object,
mispronunciations of the familiar object of varying severity, or an
unrelated nonword. Toddlers looked less to a familiar word when the
first segment was mispronounced. Moreover, they demonstrated graded
sensitivity such that a 1-feature mispronunciation yielded more looks to
an image than a 2-feature mispronunciation, and a 2-feature
mispronunciation yielded more looks than a 3-feature one. Finally, in
the nonword condition, the children looked more to the novel object than
the familiar one, demonstrating *fast referent selection* as they
associated novel words to novel objects in the moment. A similar pattern
of effects was observed in the mispronunciation study by Law and Edwards
(2015) with preschoolers mapping real words to familiar objects,
nonwords to novel objects, and equivocating about mispronunciations of
familiar words.
