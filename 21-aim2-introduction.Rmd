Referent selection {#aim2-introduction}
=======================================================================

In the earlier chapters, I studied word recognition by examining how
young listeners recognize familar words. But these children do not know
all the words they encounter. Thus, another avenue for studying word
recognition is to examine how listeners respond to unfamiliar or novel
stimuli.

How phonetically detailed are children's words?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The study I report here is a mispronunciation study. It is part of a long, productive line of research has focused on how children respond to
mispronunciations of familar words. The motivation for this research was to determine how
detailed children's phonological representations were. One hypothesis
held that infants and toddlers did not need to store words in much
phonetic or phonological detail because they know so few words. In other words, their lexicon had *underspecified* or *holistic* representations.

Some of the earliest arguments for underspecified or holistic representations come from arguments based on principles of how to design or engineer a lexicon. Namely, the sound-word learning system should be lazy: It should encode just enough phonetic detail needed to recognize a word and fill in more details as the need arises. This is what is meant by underspecification. Why encode detail on “doggie” when there are no competing items like “toggie” or “dokkie” or “tokkie”? Novice word learners have very few words, so they should need not very specified representations to recognize their first words. 
In fact, this could be advantageous: "Perhaps children benefit from the sparseness of
their lexicon by encoding only the detail necessary to distinguish
words" [@Swingley2000, p. 148]. 


I use the word *lazy* because of 

Charles-Luce and Luce (1990, 1995) are commonly cited advocates of this view. They examined the lexicons of 5 year olds, 7 year olds and adults, determined the number of phonological neighbors (words differing in just one phoneme), and found that 5-year-olds have much sparser phonological neighborhoods than adults. They argued that children do not need as detailed phonological representations of words, because they have less densely packed phonological neighborhoods.

But those argument are based on how a system *ought* to learn words. Early behavior evidence of underspecification comes from the observation that children have trouble learning minimal pairs—words differing a single phoneme segment. Barton (1976) found that 2 year olds had trouble learning minimal pairs of real words. When these children could spontaneously name words in a minimal pair (“bear” and “pear”) they could reliably choose one of those words in a forced-choice task (approx. 90% successful). But when the child had to be taught one of the words (as when a child had to learn “pear”), they were much less successful (50-60% successful). The conclusion was that the recently learned words are underspecified.




Mispronunciation studies effectively
nullified this hypothesis. For example, @Swingley2000 presented 18--23
month-olds two familiar images onscreen, like baby and dog, and heard a
correct production (*where's the baby*) or a mispronunciation (*where's
the vaby*). Children looked to the correct productions about 73% of the
time and mispronunciations 61% of the time. They look more than chance
but less than the correct production, indicating they were sensitive to
the mispronunciation. Children had encoded *baby* in enough phonetic
detail that a small phonetic change made them less certain during word
recognition. (@Swingley2002 found the same pattern of results for 14--15
month olds with 60% looks to correct productions and around 53.5% looks
for mispronunications.)





One limitation with this design is that the child has no way to reject *vaby*: They have to choose either *baby* or *dog*. @WhiteMorgan2008 explored that possibility.
<!-- @WhiteMorgan2008 changed design to include an iamge of a familiar object and a unfamiliar object on each trial. In this way, a child could reject *vaby* and treat it as a novel word that labels a novel object.  -->
They presented toddlers with images of a
familiar object and a novel object, and children heard a correct production of
the familiar object, mispronunciations of the familiar object of varying
severity, or an unrelated nonword. Toddlers looked less to a familiar
word when the first segment was mispronounced. Moreover, they
demonstrated graded sensitivity such that a 1-feature mispronunciation
yielded more looks to a familar image than a 2-feature mispronunciation,
and a 2-feature mispronunciation yielded more looks than a 3-feature
one. Finally, in the nonword condition, the children looked more to the
novel object than the familiar one, demonstrating *fast referent
selection* as they associated novel words to novel objects in the
moment. A similar pattern of effects was observed in the
mispronunciation study by @MPPaper with preschoolers mapping real words
to familiar objects, nonwords to novel objects, and equivocating about
mispronunciations of familiar words.

Swingley and Aslin (2007) trained 18 month olds on novel words. These words were either totally new words (like meb or shang) or neighbors of known words (like tog [dog] or gall [ball]). 

_add more mispronunciation findings_

As with lexical competition, it is unclear how children’s responses to
mispronunciations and novel words change over time or how individual
differences among children change over time. For example, do children
become more forgiving of mispronunciations as they mature and learn more
words? We might expect so, as children become more experienced at
listening to noisy, degraded, or misspoken speech.

_add more novel word selection findings_

Another open question involves the development of fast referent
selection. At face value, we might expect a child’s ability to associate
new words with unfamiliar objects to be more direct measure of
word-learning capacity than a child’s ability to process known words.
Under this assumption, we would expect individual differences in fast
referent selection to be correlated with vocabulary growth. But
@McMurray2012 propose that the same basic process is at play in both
recognition of familiar words and fast association of nonwords. In
experiments, the observed behaviors are the same: Children hear a word
and direct their attention to an appropriate referent. This project can
tackle these questions by describing how mispronunciations are processed
as children grow older and by examining whether familiar word
recognition and fast referent selection dissociate and which one is a
better predictor of vocabulary growth.











In programming, there is a distinction between eager and lazy evaluation. In the former, a function call like f(x, g(y)) computes the value of subfunction call g(y) immediately, but in the latter, g(y) is only computed when it is needed. If the value of g(y) is never used inside of f(), perhaps because of some if-branch, then g(y) is never evaluated, saving computation resources.
