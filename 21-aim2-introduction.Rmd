Mispronunciations and referent selection {#aim2-introduction}
=======================================================================

In the earlier chapters, I studied word recognition by examining how
young listeners recognized familiar words. But children do not know
all the words they encounter, and another avenue for studying word
recognition is to examine how listeners respond to unfamiliar or novel
stimuli. This study looks at how children responded to mispronunciations
and novel words in a two-image word-recognition experiment.

How phonetically detailed are children's words?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

There has been long, productive line of research examining how children
respond to mispronunciations of familiar words. The motivation for this
research was to determine how detailed children's phonological
representations are. One hypothesis held that infants and toddlers do
not need to store words in much phonetic or phonological detail because
they know so few words. In other words, their lexicon had
*underspecified* or *holistic* representations.

A common argument for underspecified or holistic representations poses
the building a lexicon as a design or engineering problem. It considers
the question: What would be a smart way to build up a lexicon? One
solution is that the word-learning system should be lazy, encoding
words in just enough phonetic detail to differentiate among them and adding
more details as the need arises. Early words should be
underspecified and pick up details on demand. Why fully encode the
phonetic form of "doggie" when there is no competition from similar
words like “toggie” or “dokkie” or “tokkie”? An efficient solution
would be to encode a minimal amount of phonetic detail. In fact, this
strategy could be developmentally advantageous: "Perhaps children
benefit from the sparseness of their lexicon by encoding only the detail
necessary to distinguish words" [@Swingley2000, p. 148].

Charles-Luce and Luce [-@charlesluceluce1990; -@charlesluceluce1995]
are commonly cited touchstones for this argument. Charles-Luce and Luce
compared the expressive [-@charlesluceluce1990] and receptive
[-@charlesluceluce1995] lexicons of 5- and 7-year-olds against those
of adults. They observed that adults had much denser phonological
neighborhoods than children, and they suggested that children may only
have holistic representation of words given these sparser neighborhoods.
@dollaghan1994 rebutted the 1990 study, observing that kids have
sparser neighborhoods because they have sparse lexicons. @dollaghan1994
also showed that young children do indeed have dense neighborhoods in
their lexicons. @coadyaslin2003 elaborated this claim, observing that
children's lexicons would be comparatively denser early on in
development if a child's first words are made up of more common sounds
and word shapes.

Structural studies of lexicons of this sort are rather limited. They
describe the knowledge to be learned instead of the content of the
representations throughout development. More direct evidence comes from
studies where children have difficulty learning minimal pairs. For
example, @barton1976phonemic found that 27--35-month-olds who, say, knew the
words *bear* and *pear* could differentiate them successfully (at
approximately 90% accuracy), but when the children had to learn one of
the words, then they were less successful at differentiating them
(50--60%). The discrepancy invites a conclusion that newly
learned words are underspecified.

The Switch Task, studied extensively by Werker and colleagues, also
presented evidence where young children were unable to learn a minimal
pair in the lab. In the classic switch paradigm, a child is habituated
to the ostensive naming of two novel-object/novel-word associations. In
other words, they see a novel object and hear a paired novel word
(*liff*) and see different novel object with a different paired nonword
(*neem*). Once the child is habituated, there is a critical switch trial
where the *liff*-object is displayed but labeled with the other nonword
*neem*. If the child looks longer on the switch, then we infer that they
detected the change and pay more attention because their
expectations were violated. This paradigm fits into the debate about
representations because 14-month-olds could detect the *liff*-*neem*
switch [@werker1998acquisition] but *not* a minimal pair *bih*-*dih*
switch [@stager1997infants]. 

One interpretation of these results is that children may have
underspecified representations for recently learned words. That reading
begs the question, however, of whether a child has actually "learned"
the word or just has an inchoate, less-well learned representation from
a few laboratory exposures to a nonword. In @Fennell2010, 14-month-olds
were able to detect a *bin*/*din* switch when the nonwords were treated
as words. That is, during familiarization the words were embedded in
sentence prompts like *Look. It’s the din.* or *Do you see the din?* By
changing the task in a way that makes word-learning easier, the children
encoded more phonetic detail about the words. This suggests that the
challenge of learning minimal-pair words seems to have more to do with
the difficulty of word learning rather than with how the known words are
stored. 

Against that backdrop of lexicon design strategies and minimal-pair
training studies, mispronunciation studies provide a rather direct way
to study the phonetic representations of the words that children know.
@Swingley2000 presented 18--23-month-olds two familiar images onscreen,
like baby and dog, and heard a correct production (*where's the baby*)
or a mispronunciation (*where's the vaby*). Children looked to the
correct productions about 73% of the time and mispronunciations 61% of
the time. They looked more than chance but less than the correct
production, indicating they were sensitive to the mispronunciation.
Children had encoded *baby* in enough phonetic detail that a small
phonetic change made them less certain during word recognition.
(@Swingley2002 found the same pattern of results for 14--15-month-olds
with 60% looks to correct productions and around 53.5% looks for
mispronunciations.)

A similar study by @Bailey2002 tackled the representations
of recently learned words. They created custom word-lists for children
and included mispronunciations for words that the child purportedly
learned long before testing and only recently before testing. They did
not find a difference between the two types of words, suggesting that
recently learned words were as well specified as earlier learned words.

One limitation with the @Swingley2000 design is that the child has no
way to reject *vaby*. It could be that children might treat *vaby* a
completely novel word, but they have to choose either *baby* or *dog* so
they look at the image that rhymes with the *vaby*. @WhiteMorgan2008
updated the paradigm to allow for these kind of rejections. They
presented toddlers with images of a familiar object and a novel object,
and children heard a correct production of the familiar object,
mispronunciations of the familiar object of varying severity, or an
unrelated nonword. Toddlers looked less to a familiar word when the
first segment was mispronounced, so they did not treat the
mispronunciations as nonwords. The children demonstrated graded
sensitivity such that a 1-feature mispronunciation yielded more looks to
a familiar image than a 2-feature mispronunciation, and a 2-feature
mispronunciation yielded more looks than a 3-feature one. Finally, in
the nonword condition, the children looked more to the novel object than
the familiar one, demonstrating *fast referent selection* as they
associated novel words to novel objects in the moment. In this case,
mispronunciations can vary in severity and children's responses to them
will vary in turn.

@MPPaper applied this study to preschool-age children, observing a
similar pattern of effects: Preschoolers mapped real words to familiar
objects, mapped nonwords to novel objects, and equivocated about
mispronunciations of familiar words. They also found that the child's
vocabulary size was related to these looking behaviors such children
with larger vocabularies looked more to the target in the real word and
nonword trials and looked less to the familiar object in the
mispronunciation trials. 


How to handle nonwords
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Mispronunciations are not the only nonwords a young child might hear. In
fact, if a child knows very few words, we expect them to bombarded by
new and novel words. There has been a great deal of research on how
children handle nonwords, especially when paired with a novel object as
its referent [mutual exclusivity principle, @Markman1988; Novel
Name–Nameless Category principle, @n3c]. The nonword trials in
studies like @MPPaper and @WhiteMorgan2008 can shed light on other
aspects of word recognition.

Children have a strong novelty bias when they hear nonwords. In
@Horst2011, two-year-olds were familiarized to novel objects. They were
later tested with a prompt to select a novel object (*Can you get the
fode?*) from three choices: two familiarized novel objects and one new
unfamiliarized *super-novel* object. They demonstrated a clear
preference for the super-novel object. @Mather2012 replicated the
preference a super-novel during a word recognition eyetracking task. In
this case, 22-month-old English-learning toddlers were pre-exposed to
images of novel objects. Late, during a test trial, a familiar object, a
familiarized novel object, and new unseen super-novel object appeared
onscreen with a prompt to view a nonword (*Look at the gub! Look!
Gub!*). Children looked to the novel object more than the other two
objects. In a second experiment, they removed the familiar object
leaving just the familiarized and super-novel objects. The advantage of
the super-novel object was replicated but it only emerged after the
third repetition of the trial.

A robust novelty bias raises the question of whether listener's
comprehension of familiar words and interpretation nonwords reflect
different processes. @McMurray2012 propose that the same basic process
is at play in both recognition of familiar words and fast association of
nonwords. After all, in the lab, the observed behaviors are the same:
Children hear a word (be it a real word or nonword) and direct their
attention to an appropriate referent. "To the extent that a word links
sound and meaning, any time that link is used to guide behavior, a word
is being used. Thus, word use also includes processes such as
comprehending known words, and even determining referents for new words"
[@McMurray2012, p. 832].

@Bion2013 tested referent selection of nonwords and real words
in 18-, 24-, and 30-month-olds. In the article's second experiment,
toddlers were trained on two novel words on disambiguation trials. They
would see a familiar object and an unfamiliar object and heard a prompt
with a nonword (*Where's the dofa?*). Later retention trials presented
the two unfamiliar objects were presented and prompted (*Where's the
dofa?*). Mixed in with these trials were familiar-object trials in which
a familiar object was labeled (*Where's the car?*). In that experiment,
children looked more to the target on the familiar word trials than on
the nonword disambiguation trials. For the 30-month-olds: 82% versus 68%
percentage of looks to the target. 

For @Bion2013, toddlers performed better on the familiar-word
trials than the novel-word trials. But if we think of the nonwords as
just much less familiar words, then this result is wholly
consistent with the idea that the same process operates in both familiar
word recognition and nonword referent selection. The authors,
interestingly, make a point to note that fast referent selection is not
necessary for word-learning: "Those 18-month-olds whose accuracy scores
on Disambiguation trials were lower than [*chance*] were reported to
produce as many as 389 words .... those 24-month-olds who failed to show
a disambiguation bias produced as many as 417 words". In other words, a
toddler may purportedly know hundreds of words but still not reliably
look to a novel object given a novel label. This finding raises the
possibility that nonword referent selection is not a guaranteed behavior
in young children.





The current study
------------------------------------------------------------------------

As with lexical competition, it is unclear how children’s responses to
mispronunciations and novel words change over time. For example, do
children become more forgiving of mispronunciations as they mature and
learn more words? Do familiar word recognition and nonword referent
selection ever dissociate? Relatedly, is one of these behaviors more
related to future word learning?

In this study, I report the results of a longitudinal study of word
recognition in preschoolers at age 3, age 4, and age 5. The particular
experiment here was a mispronunciation study following the paradigms of
@WhiteMorgan2008 and @MPPaper. Children saw a familiar object and
unfamiliar object and heard either a real word (*shoes*), a one-feature
mispronunciation of the word (*suze*), or a nonword (*geeve*).
The study is described in detail in [Chapter \@ref(aim2-method)](#aim2-method).

In [Chapter \@ref(real-nonword-selection)](#real-nonword-selection), I examine
children's development of referent selection in unambiguous contexts by
comparing their performance in the real word and nonword conditions. Of
interest is whether real word and nonword processing follow similar
developmental trajectories. I expect the two to be highly related, but
if they ever dissociate, it should happen with younger children. 
At face value, one might expect a child’s ability to associate
new words with unfamiliar objects to be more direct measure of
word-learning capacity than a child’s ability to process known words.
Under this assumption, I predict that nonword referent selection will be
a better measure of later vocabulary growth than familiar word
recognition.

In [Chapter \@ref(sensitivity-to-mispronunciations)](#sensitivity-to-mispronunciations), I
study how children's responses to mispronunciations changed with age. 
From the literature review above, I expect preschoolers to treat the
mispronunciations as passable but still flawed productions of known
words. As for development, I expect children to become more tolerant of
mispronunciations, based on the assumption that they become more
experienced at listening to noisy, degraded, or misspoken speech. I also
report data from age 5 where we tested children's retention of the novel
images paired with the nonwords and mispronunciations. 

Finally, in 
[Chapter \@ref(aim2-discussion)](#aim2-discussion), I describe the 
both sets of analyses together, and
[Chapter \@ref(aim2-h-check)](#aim2-h-check) reviews the results of 
my pre-analysis research hypotheses. In [Appendix \@ref(aim2-mp-items)](#aim2-mp-items), I briefly present
the results for specific mispronunciations, although item effects are 
not formally modeled.
