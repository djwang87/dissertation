Referent selection {#aim2-introduction}
=======================================================================

In the earlier chapters, I studied word recognition by examining how
young listeners recognized familar words. But these children do not know
all the words they encounter. Another avenue for studying word
recognition is to examine how listeners respond to unfamiliar or novel
stimuli. This study looks at how children responded to mispronunciations
and novel words in a two-image word recognition experiment.

How phonetically detailed are children's words?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

There has been long, productive line of research of how children respond to
mispronunciations of familar words. The motivation for this research was
to determine how detailed children's phonological representations are.
One hypothesis held that infants and toddlers do not need to store words
in much phonetic or phonological detail because they know so few words.
In other words, their lexicon had *underspecified* or *holistic*
representations.

One common argument for underspecified or holistic representations poses
the problem as a design or enginneering problem. It considers the
question: What would be a smart way to build up a lexicon? One solution
is that the lexical learning system should be lazy, encoding words in
just enough phonetic detail to differentiate others and adding more
details as the need arises. In other words, early words should be
underspecified and pick up details on demand. Why fully encode the
phonetic form of "doggie" when there is no competition from similiar
words like “toggie” or “dokkie” or “tokkie”? A more efficient solution
would be to encode a minimal amount of phonetic detail. In fact, this
strategy could be developmentally advantageous: "Perhaps children
benefit from the sparseness of their lexicon by encoding only the detail
necessary to distinguish words" [@Swingley2000, p. 148].

Charles-Luce and Luce (1990, 1995) are commonly cited touchstones for
this argument. Charles-Luce and Luce compared the expressive (1990) and
receptive (1995) lexicons of 5- and 7 year-olds against those of adults.
They observed that adults had much denser phonological neighborhoods
than the children, and they suggest that children may only have holistic
representation of words given these sparser neighborhoods. Dollaghan
(1994) rebutted the 1990 study, observing that the kids have sparser
neighborhoods because they have sparse lexicons. Dollaghan (1994) also
showed that young children indeed have packed lexicons. Coady and Aslin
(2003) observed that children's lexicons are comparatively denser early
on in development if a child's first words are made up of more common
sounds and word shapes.

Large scale structural studies of lexicons are rather limited. They describe the knowledge to be learned instead of the content of the representations throughout development.

Better to report the things that young children do.

Shvachkin (1948/1973) taught Russian children (10-24 months old) minimal pairs like gak/dak, and then requested one of the words. These children failed to discriminate the minimal pairs. Barton (1976) found that 27--35-month-olds who, say, knew the words "bear" and "pear" could differentiate them successfully, but when the children had to learn one of the words, then they were less successful at differentiating them.

found that 2-year-olds had difficulty learning minimal
pairs of real words like bear and pear. If children could spontaneously
name, say, bear and pear, they could reliably select those words in a
forced-choice test (at approximately 90% accuracy). If a child had learn
one of the pair's words, say *pear*, they were much less successful on
the forced choice task (50-60% successful). The discrepancy leads to the
conclusion that newly learned words are underspecified.





Early behavioral evidence of underspecification comes from the observation that children have trouble learning minimal pairs—words differing a single phoneme segment.

Fully encoding those phonetic features seems inefficient for the small lexicons.

Novice word learners have very few words, so they should need not very specified representations to recognize their first words. 

Extensive work by Werker and colleagues' with the Switch task has clarified things. 

The Switch Task, studied extensively by Werker and colleagues, also supports the underspecification argument. In the classic Switch paradigm, a child is habituated to the ostensive naming of two novel-object/novel-word associations. In other words, they see a novel object and hear a paired novel word (*liff*) and see different novel object with a different paired nonword (*neem*). Once the child is habituated, there is a critical switch trial where the *liff*-object is displayed but labeled with the other nonword *neem*. If the child looks longer on the switch, then we infer that they detected the change and are paying more attention because their expectations were violated. This paradigm fits into the debate about representations because 14-month-olds could detect the *liff*-*neem* switch but not a minimal pair *bih*-*dih* switch. 


Werker and colleagues consistently apply a developmental explanation for these findings. Learning a sound-object mapping is more difficult than detecting a change perceptual change. 17 month olds and 20 month olds can successfully learn bih/dih, and 14 month olds with larger vocabularies may be more successful at detecting the bih/dih switch. The older children are more experienced word-learners, so they can learn a minimal pair more easily. The 14 month olds are still novice word learners, but the ones who know more words may be more likely learn the minimal pair. The attentional and cognitive demands of word-learning for these children are too great for them to encode the fine-grained phonetic detail needed to learn a minimal pair.

These behavioral results suggest that children may have underspecified representations for recently learned words. Or that minimal pairs are harder to learn because they require a child to build up two differentiated representations.
That conclusion begs the question, however, of whether a child has actually learned the word or just has an inchoate representation from a few laboratory exposures to a nonword. They provide scant evidence that a child's representations are indeed holistic or underspecified.

Rather than focusing on how to design a lexicon or children's challenges in learning phonetically similar words, why just study the specificity of children's lexical representations? This is where the mispronunciation studies come into play.  
@Swingley2000 presented 18--23
month-olds two familiar images onscreen, like baby and dog, and heard a
correct production (*where's the baby*) or a mispronunciation (*where's
the vaby*). Children looked to the correct productions about 73% of the
time and mispronunciations 61% of the time. They look more than chance
but less than the correct production, indicating they were sensitive to
the mispronunciation. Children had encoded *baby* in enough phonetic
detail that a small phonetic change made them less certain during word
recognition. (@Swingley2002 found the same pattern of results for 14--15
month olds with 60% looks to correct productions and around 53.5% looks
for mispronunications.)

Bailey and Plunkett created custom word-lists for children and included mispronunciations for words that a child purportedly learned long before testing and only recently before testing. They did not find a difference between the two types of words.




One limitation with this design is that the child has no way to reject *vaby*: They have to choose either *baby* or *dog*. @WhiteMorgan2008 explored that possibility.
<!-- @WhiteMorgan2008 changed design to include an iamge of a familiar object and a unfamiliar object on each trial. In this way, a child could reject *vaby* and treat it as a novel word that labels a novel object.  -->
They presented toddlers with images of a
familiar object and a novel object, and children heard a correct production of
the familiar object, mispronunciations of the familiar object of varying
severity, or an unrelated nonword. Toddlers looked less to a familiar
word when the first segment was mispronounced. Moreover, they
demonstrated graded sensitivity such that a 1-feature mispronunciation
yielded more looks to a familar image than a 2-feature mispronunciation,
and a 2-feature mispronunciation yielded more looks than a 3-feature
one. Finally, in the nonword condition, the children looked more to the
novel object than the familiar one, demonstrating *fast referent
selection* as they associated novel words to novel objects in the
moment. 


Our lab showed a similar pattern of effects was observed in the
mispronunciation study by @MPPaper with preschoolers mapping real words
to familiar objects, nonwords to novel objects, and equivocating about
mispronunciations of familiar words. But in that version of the task,
children heard both a word and its mispronunciation in the same block of trials. 
Thus, they had some basis of comparison with which to deduce that a mispronunciation was not a production of the canonical form.


The experiment in this study is blah blah blah. 


For this project, I am interested in whether any developmental changes in mispronunciation process occur over the preschool years. A priori, I expect children to become more permissive.

Swingley and Aslin (2007) trained 18 month olds on novel words. These words were either totally new words (like meb or shang) or neighbors of known words (like tog [dog] or gall [ball]). 





Referent selection
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Mispronunciations are not the only nonwords a young child might hear. In fact,
if a child knows very few words, we expect them to bombarded by new and
novel words. There has been a great deal of research on how children handle 
nonwords, especially when paired with a novel object as its referent (mutual exclusivity, as in .... and novel-name nameless ....



"To the extent that a word links sound and meaning, any time that link is used to guide behavior, a word is being used. Thus, word use also includes processes such as comprehending known words, and even determining referents for new words."

Another open question involves the development of fast referent
selection. At face value, we might expect a child’s ability to associate
new words with unfamiliar objects to be more direct measure of
word-learning capacity than a child’s ability to process known words.
Under this assumption, we would expect individual differences in fast
referent selection to be correlated with vocabulary growth. But

@McMurray2012 propose that the same basic process is at play in both
recognition of familiar words and fast association of nonwords. In
experiments, the observed behaviors are the same: Children hear a word
and direct their attention to an appropriate referent. This project can
tackle these questions by describing how mispronunciations are processed
as children grow older and by examining whether familiar word
recognition and fast referent selection dissociate and which one is a
better predictor of vocabulary growth.


Children have a strong novelty bias. In @Horst2011, two-year-olds were
familiarized to novel objects. They were later tested with a prompt to
select a novel object (*Can you get the fode?*) from three choices: two
familiarized novel objects and one new unfamiliarized *super-novel*
object. They demonstrated a clear preference for the super-novel object.
@Mather2012 replicated the preference a super-novel during a word
recognition eyetracking task. In this case, 22-month-old
English-learning toddlers were pre-exposed to images of novel objects.
Late, during a test trial, a familiar object, a familiarized novel
object, and new unseen super-novel object appeared onscreen with a
prompt to view a nonword (*Look at the gub! Look! Gub!*). Children
looked to the novel object more than the other two objects. In a second
experiment, they removed the familiar object leaving just the
familiarized and super-novel objects. The advantage of the super-novel
object only emerged after the third repetition of the trial.





@Bion2013 tested referent selection in 18-, 24-, and 30-month-olds. In
that article's second experiment, toddlers were trained on two novel
words on disambiguation trials. They would see a familiar object and an
unfamiliar object and hear a prompt with a nonword (*Where's the dofa?*). Later retention
trials presented the two unfamilar objects were presented and prompted (*Where's the dofa?*). 
Mixed in with these trials were familiar-object trials in which a
familiar object was labeled (*Where's the car?*). In that experiment, children
looked more to the target on the familiar word trials than on the
nonword disambiguation trials. For the 30-month olds: 82% versus 68% percentage of
looks to the target. 


Importantly, they found a correlation between CDI
expressive vocabulary and proportion of looks on disambiguation trials,
r(61) = .37, (this is a partial correlation that controls for age). 

Interestingly, they found that children performed better on the familiar-word than the novel-word trials. The authors, however, make a point to note that fast referent selection is not necessary for word-learning: "Those 18-month-olds whose accuracy scores on Disambiguation trials were lower than [*chance*] were reported to produce as many as 389 words .... those 24-month-olds who failed to show a disambiguation bias produced as many as 417 words". In other words, a toddler may purportedly know hundreds of words but still not reliably look to a novel object given a novel label.



The current study
------------------------------------------------------------------------


As with lexical competition, it is unclear how children’s responses to
mispronunciations and novel words change over time or how individual
differences among children change over time. For example, do children
become more forgiving of mispronunciations as they mature and learn more
words? We might expect so, as children become more experienced at
listening to noisy, degraded, or misspoken speech.

<!-- In programming, there is a distinction between eager and lazy evaluation. In the former, a function call like f(x, g(y)) computes the value of subfunction call g(y) immediately, but in the latter, g(y) is only computed when it is needed. If the value of g(y) is never used inside of f(), perhaps because of some if-branch, then g(y) is never evaluated, saving computation resources. -->
