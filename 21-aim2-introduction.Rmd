Referent selection {#aim2-introduction}
=======================================================================

In the earlier chapters, I studied word recognition by examining how
young listeners recognize familar words. But these children do not know
all the words they encounter. Thus, another avenue for studying word
recognition is to examine how listeners respond to unfamiliar or novel
stimuli.

One productive line of research has focused on how children respond to
mispronunciations of familar words [e.g., @Swingley2000;
@Swingley2002]. @WhiteMorgan2008 presented toddlers with images of a
familiar and novel object, and children heard a correct production of
the familiar object, mispronunciations of the familiar object of varying
severity, or an unrelated nonword. Toddlers looked less to a familiar
word when the first segment was mispronounced. Moreover, they
demonstrated graded sensitivity such that a 1-feature mispronunciation
yielded more looks to a familar image than a 2-feature mispronunciation,
and a 2-feature mispronunciation yielded more looks than a 3-feature
one. Finally, in the nonword condition, the children looked more to the
novel object than the familiar one, demonstrating *fast referent
selection* as they associated novel words to novel objects in the
moment. A similar pattern of effects was observed in the
mispronunciation study by @MPPaper with preschoolers mapping real words
to familiar objects, nonwords to novel objects, and equivocating about
mispronunciations of familiar words.

As with lexical competition, it is unclear how children’s responses to
mispronunciations and novel words change over time or how individual
differences among children change over time. For example, do children
become more forgiving of mispronunciations as they mature and learn more
words? We might expect so, as children become more experienced at
listening to noisy, degraded, or misspoken speech.

Another open question involves the development of fast referent
selection. At face value, we might expect a child’s ability to associate
new words with unfamiliar objects to be more direct measure of
word-learning capacity than a child’s ability to process known words.
Under this assumption, we would expect individual differences in fast
referent selection to be highly correlated with vocabulary growth. But
@McMurray2012 propose that the same basic process is at play in both
recognition of familiar words and fast association of nonwords. In
experiments, the observed behaviors are the same: Children hear a word
and direct their attention to an appropriate referent. This project can
tackle these questions by describing how mispronunciations are processed
as children grow older and by examining whether familiar word
recognition and fast referent selection dissociate and which one is a
better predictor of vocabulary growth.
