General Discussion
=======================================================================

This study examined the development of familiar word recognition over
the preschool years. The word recognition data came from a visual-world
eyetracking experiment which recorded children's fixations to images in
response to prompts like *see the bear*. The trials featured a target
noun along with a phonological competitor, a semantic competitor, and an
unrelated image. To describe children's word recognition ability, I
analyzed how the probability of fixating on the target image changed
over the time course of a trial. The presence of the competitor images
also allowed additional analyses about children's sensitivities to the
phonological and semantic competitors. The experiment was conducted as
part of a three-year longitudinal study; children were 28–39 months-old
at the Age 3 visit, 39–52 at Age 4, and 51–65 at Age 5. The longitudinal
design allowed me to describe developmental changes in word recognition.




Learn words and learn connections between words
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Children showed year-over-year improvements in word recognition, as
measured by average looking probabilities, peak looking probabilities,
and the rate of change in looking probabilities. Children became faster,
more reliable, and less uncertain during recognizing familar words. At
the same time, children also became more sensitive to the phonological
and semantic competitors. With each year, children looked more to the
target image, but when they erred, they were more likely to err on a
lexical relevant word.

These developmental patterns can be interpreted in terms of lexical
activation and processing dynamics. In this task, children hear a
stream of speech and activate some phonetic, phonemic, lexical, and
semantic representations that match the speech input. As they hear more
of a word, the activation builds until a particular word is favored, and
children shift their gaze onto the named image. Let's imagine that we
have to engineer this system. To make this system more efficient, we have
to find ways to increase the relative activation of the correct word. In
particular, we can increase the strength of connections so that
activation can propagate more efficiently through the system, and we can
inhibit competing words so that the correct word can win out over its
competitors more quickly.

The results from these studies indicate that children become more
efficient at activating the target word *and related words* over the
preschool years. As they grew older, children were faster to look at a
named image and more likely to fixate on the phonological competitor
(compared to the unrelated image). These two findings
reflect changes in how (partial) acoustic information can propagate to
activate phonologically plausible words. The phonological competitors
shared the same syllable onset as the target noun (e.g.,
*dress*–*drum*), so the early part of the word matched both of these
words. That children became more sensitive to the phonological
competitor with age means that they learned the phonological
similarities among words, because part of a word activated a
neighborhood of phonological plausible matches. This developmental
change supports faster word recognition because the listener can channel
activation to relevant words more quickly.

The other mechanism we might tune to improve word recognition is inhibition.
Children's looks to the phonological or semantic competitors were
temporary: Looks increase to some peak level and then quickly decrease.
Behaviorally, the drop in looking probability reflects the rejection of
an interpretation: for example, a child hears "dr", shifts looks to *dress*,
but hears "um", revises the interpretation and jumps to *drum*.
We can interpret these corrections as evidence for an inhibitory
process: Corrections indicate a change in relative activation where a
different word overrides an initial interpretation. But the evidence for
*developmental changes* in lexical inhibition from these data was scant.
The rate of rejection of the phonological competitor---that is, how
quickly looks fall from their peak value---did not change from age 4
to age 5, although the rate did increase for the semantic competitor
from age 4 to age 5. Preschoolers did demonstrate inhibition by revising
their interpretations of nouns, but there were no clear developmental
changes in inhibition.

In summary, preschoolers showed increased activation of the target noun
and semantically and phonologically related words but little
developmental change in lexical inhibition. Paired with the findings
from older children, these results lead to a compelling developmental
story. @Rigler2015 compared 9- and 16-year-olds on a visual-world word
recognition experiment with phonologial (cohort and rime) competitors.
The younger children were slower to look to the target image and showed
more looks to the competitors. The implications are that children's word
recognition is still developing in late childhood and that in
particular, children's inhibition of lexical competitors became stronger
with age.

The current study with 3-, 4-, and 5-year-olds followed a different
pattern: Relative looks to the competitor images increased with age.
Taken together, these two studies suggest an interesting progression for the
development of lexical processing. During the preschool years, children
learn many, many words, and they establish phonological and semantic
connections between words. These connections support the immediate
activation of neighborhoods of words. Late childhood, based on the
@Rigler2015 findings, then is a time for refinement of those
connections, so that sensitivity to the competitors decreases. This
refinement could follow from more selective activation channels,
increased lexical inhibition, or likely a combination of both.




Another dimension of this study concerned individual differences in word
recognition. Some children were faster or more accurate during word
recognition, and these children were more likely to faster or more
accurate at later ages. The magnitude of these differences diminished
over time, so that children approached a more mature level of
performance. In terms of lexical processing dynamics, we might think of
early differences as reflecting early differences in the burgeoning
lexicon. Children may have different numbers of words, different degrees
of experience with some words, less established connections among words,
and at a lower level, different phonetic and speech perception
abilities. Differences in word recognition are greatest early on in
development because this is when the differences among children's
lexicons is greatest. The task of learning new words, and more
importantly, of developing representations and associations to organize
words normalizes the differences among children's lexicons.[^haystack]
That pressure would make the overall variability among children decrease
over time while still preserving a relative ordering among children.

[^haystack]: Earlier I had used a needle-in-a-haystack metaphor for
lexical access and said that the way to cope with finding a needle in an
ever-growing haystack is to sort the hay and organize the straws. We
might apply the reasoning backwards in time too: Early on, with just a
few straws, an ad hoc or inefficient organization can suffice.

We can also interpret the predictive power of word recognition measures
in terms of lexical processing and lexical organization. Correlations
between word recognition performance and future vocabulary were
strongest for the age-3 growth curve features, in particular for the
peak probability of looking to the target word. The peak probability
measures the overall certainty in word recognition and how strongly the
target word is activated. Children with more efficient representations
of familiar words at age 3 have a stronger foundation for learning
future words, and as a result, they had larger vocabularies at age 4 and
age 5.


...These findings have implications for our understanding of word learning and word recognition.

differences are real, stable, and most discriminating at younger ages.

the way to intervene is to act early.

Children become better at recognizing words by learning similarities among words and using those similarities to activate neighborhoods of lexically relevant words. Rather than just measuring vocabulary size, word recognition reflects how well words have been integrated into the lexicon.

...limitations

This research has some limitations. The experimental design included
semantic and phonological competitors on every trial, so isolating out
the semantic and phonological competition effects required some
subtlety. A more direct design would compare different types of a
trials: for example, a target vs. three unrelated images condition, and
a target vs. a competitor vs. two unrelated images condition. The trials
also used different kinds of semantic and phonological competitors. For
example, two of the phonological competitors rhymed with the target, so
they could not be included the analysis of phonological competitors
(which focused competitors with the same onset as the target). The
current design limited the number of trials that could be used in the
analyses of the competitors and weakened the power of the analyses.

Another limitation include changes in the experiment procedure over the
course of the longitudinal study. From age 3 to age 4, we re-recorded
the stimuli (with the same original speakers) so that the durations
between the two different dialect versions of the experiment were
similar. From age 4 to age 5, we also shortened the duration of the
trials by removing attention-getting prompt (e.g, *this is fun!*) from
the ends of the trials. These small procedural changes mean that
year-to-year differences do not reflect *pure* development differences.
It is very implausible, however, that the robust year-over-changes owe
more to procedural changes than a year of learning and language
development.
