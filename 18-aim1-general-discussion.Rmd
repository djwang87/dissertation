General Discussion
=======================================================================

This study examined the development of familiar word recognition over
the preschool years. The word recognition data came from a visual-world
eyetracking experiment which recorded children's fixations to images in
response to prompts like *see the bear*. The trials featured a target
noun along with a phonological competitor, a semantic competitor, and an
unrelated image. To describe children's word recognition ability, I
analyzed how the probability of fixating on the target image changed
over the time course of a trial. The presence of the competitor images
also allowed additional analyses about children's sensitivities to the
phonological and semantic competitors. The experiment was conducted as
part of a three-year longitudinal study; children were 28–39 months-old
at the Age 3 visit, 39–52 at Age 4, and 51–65 at Age 5. The longitudinal
design allowed me to describe developmental changes in word recognition.




Learn words and learn connections between words
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Children showed year-over-year improvements in word recognition, as
measured by average looking probabilities, peak looking probabilities,
and the rate of change in looking probabilities. Children became faster,
more reliable, and less uncertain during recognizing familar words. At
the same time, children also became more sensitive to the phonological
and semantic competitors. With each year, children looked more to the
target image, but when they erred, they were more likely to err on a
lexical relevant word.

These developmental patterns can be interpreted in terms of lexical
activation and processing dynamics. In this task, children hear a
stream of speech and activate some phonetic, phonemic, lexical, and
semantic representations that match the speech input. As they hear more
of a word, the activation builds until a particular word is favored, and
children shift their gaze onto the named image. Let's imagine that we
have to engineer this system. To make this system more efficient, we have
to find ways to increase the relative activation of the correct word. In
particular, we can increase the strength of connections so that
activation can propagate more efficiently through the system, and we can
inhibit competing words so that the correct word can win out over its
competitors more quickly.

The results from these studies indicate that children become more
efficient at activating the target word *and related words* over the
preschool years. As they grew older, children were faster to look at a
named image and more likely to fixate on the phonological competitor
(compared to the unrelated image) as they grew older. These two findings
reflect changes in how quickly partial acoustic information can
activate a phonological plausible word. The phonological competitors
shared the same syllable onset as the target noun (e.g.,
*dress*–*drum*), so the early part of the word matched both of these
words. That children became more sensitive to the phonological
competitor with age means that they learned the phonological
similarities among words, because part of a word activated a
neighborhood of phonological plausible matches. This development
supports faster word recognition because it would channel activation to
relevant words more quickly.

The other mechanism we might tune is inhibition.
Children's looks to the phonological or semantic competitors were
temporary: Looks increases to some peak level and then quickly decrease.
Behaviorally, the drop in looking probability reflects the rejection of
an interpretation: for example, a child hears "dr", jumps to *dress*,
but hear "um", revises the interpretation and shifts looks to *drum*.
We could interpret these corrections as evidence for an inhibitory
process: Corrections reflect change in relative activation where a
different word overrides an initial interpretation. But the evidence for 
_developmental changes_ in lexical inhibition was scant: The rate of
rejection of the phonological competitor did not change from age 4 to
age 5, although rate did increase for the semantic competitor from
age 4 to age 5.

These results, paired with the findings from older children, lead to a
compelling developmental story. @Rigler2015 compared 9- and 16-year-olds
on a visual-world word recognition experiment with cohort and rime
competitors. The younger children in that study were slower to look to
the target image and showed more looks to the competitor images. The
implications are that children's lexical processing is still developing
in late childhood and that in particular, children's inhibition of
lexical competitors became stronger with age.

The current results with 3-, 4-, and 5-year-olds followed a different
pattern: Relative looks to the competitor images increased with age.
Taken together, the results suggest an interesting progression for the
development of lexical processing. During the preschool years, children
learn many, many words, and they establish phonological and semantic
connections between words. These connections support immediate
activation of neighborhoods of words. Late childhood, based on the
@Rigler2015 findings, would be a time for refinement of those
connections, so that sensitivity to the competitors decreases. This
refinement could follow from more selective activation channels,
increased lexical inhibition, or likely a combination of both.

I described and modeled children's word recognition performance using
growth curves that measured children's probability of fixating on a
named word during a trial. We can interpret these growth curves in terms
of lexical activation and processing dynamics.  The time course of fixation probabilities reflect the time of lexical activation. Indeed, many simulation studies make this connection explicit, mapping looking patterns onto activations from word recognition models [].

Another dimension of this research concerned individual differences in
word recognition. Some children were faster or more accurate word
recognition, and these children were more likely to faster or more
accurate at later ages. The magnitude of these differences diminished
over time, so that children approached a more mature level of
performance. In terms of lexical processing dynamics, we might think of
early differences to reflect early differences in the burgeoning
lexicon. Children may have different numbers of words, different degrees
of experience with some words, less established connections among words,
and at a lower level, different phonetic and speech perception
abilities. Differences in word recognition are greatest early in
development because the differences among the lexicons is greatest. The
task of learning new words, and more importantly, of developing
representations and associations to organize words normalize the differences
among children's lexicons.[^haystack] That pressure would make the
overall variability among children decrease with age while still
preserving the relative ordering among children. A precocious listener
will build on their early head start.


[^haystack]: Earlier I had used a needle-in-a-haystack metaphor for
lexical access and said that the way to cope with finding a needle in an
ever-growing haystack is to sort the hay and organize the straws. We
might apply the reasoning backwards in time too: Early on, with just a
few straws, an ad hoc or inefficient organization can be just fine.

...outline limitations

This research has some limitations. The experimental design included
semantic and phonological competitors on every trial, so isolating out
the semantic and phonological competition effects required some
subtlety. A more direct design would compare different types of a
trials: for example, a target vs. three unrelated images condition, and
a target vs. a competitor vs. two unrelated images condition. The trials
also used different kinds of semantic and phonological competitors. For
example, two of the phonological competitors rhymed with the target, so
they could not be included the analysis of phonological competitors
(which focused competitors with the same onset as the target). The
current design limited the number of trials that could be used in the
analyses of the competitors and weakened the power of the analyses.

Another limitation include changes in the experiment procedure over the
course of the longitudinal study. From age 3 to age 4, we re-recorded
the stimuli (with the same original speakers) so that the durations
between the two different dialect versions of the experiment were
similar. From age 4 to age 5, we also shortened the duration of the
trials by removing attention-getting prompt (e.g, *this is fun!*) from
the ends of the trials. These small procedural changes mean that
year-to-year differences do not reflect *pure* development differences.
It is very implausible, however, that the robust year-over-changes owe
more to procedural changes than a year of learning and language
development.
