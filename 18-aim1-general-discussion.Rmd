General Discussion
=======================================================================

This study examined the development of familiar word recognition over
the preschool years. The word recognition data came from a Visual World
Paradigm eyetracking experiment which recorded children's fixations to
images in response to prompts like *see the bear*. The trial displays
featured a target noun along with a phonological competitor, a semantic
competitor, and an unrelated image. The experiment was conducted as part
of a three-year longitudinal study; children were 28–39 months-old at
the Age 3 visit, 39–52 at Age 4, and 51–65 at Age 5. To describe
children's word recognition ability, I analyzed how the probability of
fixating on the target image changed over the time course of a trial.
The presence of the competitor images also allowed additional analyses
about children's sensitivities to the phonological and semantic
competitors. The longitudinal design allowed me to describe
developmental changes in word recognition.

Children showed year-over-year improvements in word recognition, as measured by
average and peak looking probabilities and the rate of change in looking
probabilities. Children were more faster and more reliable at recognizing familar words. In terms of lexical processing, words became activated more strongly (higher peak looks to the target) and more quickly (steeper word changes in word recognition probability).

How can word recognition improve: Stronger activation: energy enters system more quickly. Or less activation: greater inhibition of competitors so competition resolves more quickly.

At the same time, however, children became more sensitive to the phonological and semantic competitors. Each year, children looked more to the target image, and when they erred, they were more likely to err on a lexical relevant word. 

Results suggest the former option: The system is getting more efficient at activation.
