Specific Procedure: Aim 2 (Referent Selection and Mispronunciations)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

*Mispronunciation Task.* This experiment is an adaptation of the
mispronunciation detection task by @WhiteMorgan2008 and @MPPaper. 
In this experiment, two images are presented onscreen—a
familiar object and an unfamiliar object—and the child hears a prompt to
view one of the images. In the *correct pronunciation* (or *real word*)
and *mispronunciation* conditions, the child hears either the familiar
word (e.g., *soup*) or a one-feature mispronunciation of the first
consonant of the target word ([*sh*]*oup*). Importantly, within a
block of trials, the child never hears both the correct and
mispronounced forms of the word. These conditions are designed to test
whether children map mispronunciations to novel words. To encourage fast
referent selection, there were also trials in a *nonword* condition
where the label was an unambiguous novel word (e.g., *cheem* presented
with images of a bed and a novel-looking pastry mixer). Each nonword was
constructed to match the phonotactic probability of one of the
mispronunciations.

is mispronounced as “guck”.

```

In a block of trials, there were 12 trials each from the nonword
condition, correct production condition, and mispronunciation
conditions, and children received two blocks of the experiment. A
complete list of the items used in the experiment over the three years
of the study is included in 
[Appendix \@ref(mp-experiment-items)](#mp-experiment-items).
