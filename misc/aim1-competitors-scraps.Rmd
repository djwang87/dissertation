<!-- Talking points: -->

<!--   - There is hardly an effect of the phonological foil during timepoint 1. There -->
<!--     are a few ways to interpret this finding. The first may be artefactual. The -->
<!--     stimuli were re-recorded at timepoint 2 so the timepoint 1 stimuli were -->
<!--     somewhat longer on average (). -->
<!--     However, with slower stimuli, we would still expect an inflection in looks -->
<!--     to the foil as children have more time to activate the phonological -->
<!--     representations to the cohort. In other words, with more time to respond, -->
<!--     there could plausibly be an even greater effect of early phonological -->
<!--     information. -->
<!--   - Alternatively, the children in timepoint 1 may not be using the early -->
<!--     similarity of words during word recognition. That is, instead of immediate -->
<!--     incremental activation of lexical cohorts, the children may not be -->
<!--     activating the cohorts as reliably. This would imply that further study is -->
<!--     required on the evidence for when young children begin to show immediate -->
<!--     activation of cohorts. -->




<!--   - If children were just confused between bear/horse, fly/bee, -->
<!--     goat/sheep, etc., they should be confused more at younger ages when -->
<!--     they know much less about the world. So if it were confusion or -->
<!--     guess, the semantic foil should be stronger at age 3. But they are -->
<!--     also slower at word recognition in general at younger ages, so maybe -->
<!--     these things cancel each other out? -->
    
  
<!-- [^goat] -->

<!-- [^goat]: Anecdote! I was drawn to the general confusion idea, -->
<!-- partially because I grew up on a farm where we raised sheep. I can -->
<!-- remember plenty of people, much older than preschool age, calling the -->
<!-- sheep *goats*. Surely, a bunch of non-rural preschoolers would be in a -->
<!-- similar situation, confusing sheep and goats, right? But naming is -->
<!-- harder than recognition. I imagine that the goat-mislabellers could -->
<!-- point to the right animal if I showed a picture of a goat next to a -->
<!-- picture of a sheep. Indeed, we piloted these images in preschool -->
<!-- classrooms, by having children point to images in the presense of the -->
<!-- phonological and semantic competitors. -->




<!-- Phon looks scraps. -->





<!-- semantic scraps: -->

<!-- The looking patterns---that is, the shapes of the growth curves---were largely the same for each year. The main differences were that the age-3 curve was about 100&nbsp;ms slower to rise than the age-4 curve and that the age-5 curve -->

<!--   - That the effect of the foil increases each year indicates that the -->
<!--     semantic representations of words have strengthened. -->
<!--   - Is inhibition coming online at age 5? -->



<!-- Talking points : -->

<!-- * I tested whether two child-level features predicted looks to the competitor image at age 3. -->
<!-- * One a priori expectation was that looks to the phonological foil would relate to phonological discrimination ability, because children who can reliably discriminate one-feature phonetic differences between words would have richer phonological or phonetic representations that supported word recognition. -->

<!-- * The other a prior expectation was that looks to semantic foil would relate to looks to the receptive vocabulary. However, neither predicted related to looks the semantic foil. -->





<!-- What's going on here: -->

<!--   - The weak phonological foils are indeed weaker than the strong foils. -->
<!--   - The strong semantic foils appear stronger than the weak ones. The -->
<!--     strong foils show a growth curve pattern of increasing looks away -->
<!--     from baseline and there a developmental difference among the growth -->
<!--     curves for each time point. -->
<!--   - Children have a lower advantage for the target (vs unrelated) in -->
<!--     weak foil trials because... why? My reading is that if the semantic -->
<!--     or phonological foil is effective, children will look at it instead -->
<!--     of the unrelated image. Conversely, if the semantic or phonological -->
<!--     foil are less effective, children will look more to the unrelated -->
<!--     image, which pulls down the ratio of looks to target versus the -->
<!--     unrelated image. -->



<!-- Each curve is the log odds of looking to the target, phonological foil, and -->
<!-- semantic foil versus the unrelated word. Positive values mean more looks to an -->
<!-- image type than the unrelated. If you think of the _y_ axis as the image's -->
<!-- _relatedness_ to the target, you can see a time course of relatedness in each -->
<!-- panel: Here early phonological effects meaning early relatedness and later, -->
<!-- flatter semantic effects meaning late relatedness. (These effects make even more -->
<!-- sense sense if phonological representations affect processing before semantic -->
<!-- ones.) -->

<!-- This plot suggests an important finding: Children becoming more sensitive to the -->
<!-- phonological and semantic foils as they grow older. Jan and I had made -->
<!-- opposite predictions about whether this would happen. Her argument, I think, was -->
<!-- that children become better at word recognition by becoming better able to -->
<!-- inhibit interference from competing words. This plot would suggest that they -->
<!-- show increased sensitive to the target and foils words by looking less to the -->
<!-- unrelated word as they age and reapportioning those looks to the other three -->
<!-- lexically relevant words. -->
