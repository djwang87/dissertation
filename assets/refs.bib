              growth, and slow growth predicts later academic difficulties. In this
              study, we explored how the amount of speech directed to infants in
              Spanish-speaking families low in socioeconomic status influenced the
              development of children's skill in real-time language processing and
              vocabulary learning. All-day recordings of parent-infant interactions at
              home revealed striking variability among families in how much speech
              caregivers addressed to their child. Infants who experienced more
              child-directed speech became more efficient in processing familiar words
              in real time and had larger expressive vocabularies by the age of 24
              months, although speech simply overheard by the child was unrelated to
              vocabulary outcomes. Mediation analyses showed that the effect of
              child-directed speech on expressive vocabulary was explained by infants'
              language-processing efficiency, which suggests that richer language
              experience strengthens processing skills that facilitate language
              growth.},

  abstract = {The degree to which infants represent phonetic detail in
              words has been a source of controversy in phonology and developmental
              psychology. One prominent hypothesis holds that infants store words in a
              vague or inaccurate form until the learning of similar-sounding
              neighbors forces attention to subtle phonetic distinctions. In the
              experiment reported here, we used a visual fixation task to assess word
              recognition. We present the first evidence indicating that, in fact, the
              lexical representations of 14- and 15-month-olds are encoded in fine
              detail, even when this detail is not functionally necessary for
              distinguishing similar words in the infant's vocabulary. Exposure to
              words is sufficient for well-specified lexical representations, even
              well before the vocabulary spurt. These results suggest developmental
              continuity in infants' representations of speech: As infants begin to
              build a vocabulary and learn word meanings, they use the perceptual
              abilities previously demonstrated in tasks testing the discrimination
              and categorization of meaningless syllables.},

              words has been a focus of debate for many years, little is known about
              the lexical representations very young children use in word recognition.
              In particular, researchers have questioned the degree of specificity
              encoded in early lexical representations. The current study addressed
              this issue by presenting 18-23-month-olds with object labels that were
              either correctly pronounced, or mispronounced. Mispronunciations
              involved replacement of one segment with a similar segment, as in
              'baby-vaby'. Children heard sentences containing these words while
              viewing two pictures, one of which was the referent of the sentence.
              Analyses of children's eye movements showed that children recognized the
              spoken words in both conditions, but that recognition was significantly
              poorer when words were mispronounced. The effects of mispronunciation on
              recognition were unrelated to age or to spoken vocabulary size. The
              results suggest that children's representations of familiar words are
              phonetically well-specified, and that this specification may not be a
              consequence of the need to differentiate similar words in production.},

  abstract = {The TRACE model of speech perception (McClelland \& Elman,
              1986) is used to simulate results from the infant word recognition
              literature, to provide a unified, theoretical framework for interpreting
              these findings. In a first set of simulations, we demonstrate how TRACE
              can reconcile apparently conflicting findings suggesting, on the one
              hand, that consonants play a pre-eminent role in lexical acquisition
              (Nespor, Pe\~{n}a \& Mehler, 2003; Nazzi, 2005), and on the other, that
              there is a symmetry in infant sensitivity to vowel and consonant
              mispronunciations of familiar words (Mani \& Plunkett, 2007). In a
              second series of simulations, we use TRACE to simulate infants' graded
              sensitivity to mispronunciations of familiar words as reported by White
              and Morgan (2008). An unexpected outcome is that TRACE fails to
              demonstrate graded sensitivity for White and Morgan's stimuli unless the
              inhibitory parameters in TRACE are substantially reduced. We explore the
              ramifications of this finding for theories of lexical development.
              Finally, TRACE mimics the impact of phonological neighbourhoods on early
              word learning reported by Swingley and Aslin (2007). TRACE offers an
              alternative explanation of these findings in terms of mispronunciations
              of lexical items rather than imputing word learning to infants. Together
              these simulations provide an evaluation of Developmental (Jusczyk, 1993)
              and Familiarity (Metsala, 1999) accounts of word recognition by infants
              and young children. The findings point to a role for both theoretical
              approaches whereby vocabulary structure and content constrain infant
              word recognition in an experience-dependent fashion, and highlight the
              continuity in the processes and representations involved in lexical
              development during the second year of life.},

abstract = {We used eye-tracking to investigate lexical processing in aphasic participants by examining the fixation time course for rhyme (e.g., carrot-. parrot) and cohort (e.g., beaker-. beetle) competitors. Broca's aphasic participants exhibited larger rhyme competition effects than age-matched controls. A re-analysis of previously reported data (Yee, Blumstein, {\&} Sedivy, 2008) confirmed that Wernicke's aphasic participants exhibited larger cohort competition effects. Individual-level analyses revealed a negative correlation between rhyme and cohort competition effect size across both groups of aphasic participants. Computational model simulations were performed to examine which of several accounts of lexical processing deficits in aphasia might account for the observed effects. Simulation results revealed that slower deactivation of lexical competitors could account for increased cohort competition in Wernicke's aphasic participants; auditory perceptual impairment could account for increased rhyme competition in Broca's aphasic participants; and a perturbation of a parameter controlling selection among competing alternatives could account for both patterns, as well as the correlation between the effects. In light of these simulation results, we discuss theoretical accounts that have the potential to explain the dynamics of spoken word recognition in aphasia and the possible roles of anterior and posterior brain regions in lexical processing and cognitive control. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

@article {TRACE,
abstract = {We describe a model called the TRACE model of speech perception. The model is based on the principles of interactive activation. Information processing takes place through the excitatory and inhibitory interactions of a large number of simple processing units, each working continuously to update its own activation on the basis of the activations of other units to which it is connected. The model is called the TRACE model because the network of units forms a dynamic pro- cessing structure called “the Trace,” which serves at once as the perceptual processing mechanism and as the system's working memory. The model is in- stantiated in two simulation programs. TRACE 1. described in detail elsewhere. deals with short segments of real speech, and suggests a mechanism for coping with the fact that the cues to the identity of phonemes vary as a function of context. TRACE II, the focus of this article, simulates a large number of empirical findings on the perception of phonemes and words and on the interactions of phoneme and word perception. At the phoneme level, TRACE II simulates the influence of lexical information on the identification of phonemes and accounts for the fact that lexical effects are found under certain conditions but not others. The model also shows how knowledge of phonological constraints can be em- bodied in particular lexical items but can still be used to influence processing of novel, nonword utterances. The model also exhibits categorical perception and The the ability to trade cues off against each other in phoneme identification. At the word level, the model captures the major positive feature of Marslen-Wilson's COHORT model of speech perception, in that it shows immediate sensitivity to information favoring one word or set of words over others. At the same time, it overcomes a difftculty with the COHORT model: it can recover from underspec- itication or mispronunciation of a word's beginning. TRACE II also uses lexical information to segment a stream of speech into a sequence of words and to find word beginnings and endings, and it simulates a number of recent findings related to these points. The TRACE model has some limitations, but we believe it is a step toward a psychologically and computationally adequate model of the process of speech perception.},

@article{Marslen-Wilson1989,
abstract = {Approaches to spoken word recognition differ in the importance they assign to word onsets during lexical access. This research contrasted the hypothesis that lexical access is strongly directional with the hypothesis that word onsets are less important than the overall goodness of fit between input and lexical form. A cross-modal priming technique was used to investigate the extent to which a rhyme prime (a prime that differs only in its first segment from the word that is semantically associated with the visual probe) is as effective a prime as the original word itself. Earlier research had shown that partial primes that matched from word onset were very effective cross-modal primes. The present results show that, irrespective of whether the rhyme prime was a real word or not, and irrespective of the amount of overlap between the rhyme prime and the original word, the rhymes are much less effective primes than the full word. In fact, no overall priming effect could be detected at all except under conditions in which the competitor environment was very sparse. This suggests that word onsets do have a special status in the lexical access of spoken words.},

              grammatical development over the second year. In this follow-up study,
              children originally tested as infants were assessed at 8 years on
              standardized tests of language, cognition, and working memory. Speed of
