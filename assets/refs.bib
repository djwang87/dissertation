              child-directed speech became more efficient in processing familiar words
              in real time and had larger expressive vocabularies by the age of 24
              months, although speech simply overheard by the child was unrelated to

  abstract = {The degree to which infants represent phonetic detail in
              words has been a source of controversy in phonology and developmental
              psychology. One prominent hypothesis holds that infants store words in a
              vague or inaccurate form until the learning of similar-sounding
              neighbors forces attention to subtle phonetic distinctions. In the
              experiment reported here, we used a visual fixation task to assess word
              recognition. We present the first evidence indicating that, in fact, the
              lexical representations of 14- and 15-month-olds are encoded in fine
              detail, even when this detail is not functionally necessary for
              distinguishing similar words in the infant's vocabulary. Exposure to
              words is sufficient for well-specified lexical representations, even
              well before the vocabulary spurt. These results suggest developmental
              continuity in infants' representations of speech: As infants begin to
              build a vocabulary and learn word meanings, they use the perceptual
              abilities previously demonstrated in tasks testing the discrimination
              and categorization of meaningless syllables.},

              words has been a focus of debate for many years, little is known about
              the lexical representations very young children use in word recognition.
              In particular, researchers have questioned the degree of specificity
              encoded in early lexical representations. The current study addressed
              this issue by presenting 18-23-month-olds with object labels that were
              either correctly pronounced, or mispronounced. Mispronunciations
              involved replacement of one segment with a similar segment, as in
              'baby-vaby'. Children heard sentences containing these words while
              viewing two pictures, one of which was the referent of the sentence.
              Analyses of children's eye movements showed that children recognized the
              spoken words in both conditions, but that recognition was significantly
              poorer when words were mispronounced. The effects of mispronunciation on
              recognition were unrelated to age or to spoken vocabulary size. The
              results suggest that children's representations of familiar words are
              phonetically well-specified, and that this specification may not be a
              consequence of the need to differentiate similar words in production.},

@article{Bailey2002,
abstract = {Young children often fail to distinguish words differing by a single phoneme. It has been suggested that the phonological representations associated with early words are under-specified, with detail being added either as required to distinguish more words as a child's vocabulary increases, or as a function of the amount of exposure a child has had to a particular word. We report on an inter-modal preferential looking task in which 48, 18- and 24-month-olds heard either accurate pronunciations of picture names or slight (1- or 2-feature) mispronunciations. Each child was tested on four words that they learned at a very young age, and four words they had learned only recently relative to the test session. Across all children, 30 different words were tested. Analysis of children's looking behavior found differences between their responses to accurate and inaccurate pronunciations. These results show that toddlers' representations for words have enough detail to detect even slight mispronunciations. This ability was unaffected by their age, the size of their receptive vocabulary, the neighborhood density of individual test words, or the recency with which words had been learned. The results suggest that the specificity of lexical representations may be unrelated to any of these factors, at least within the range of ages and word familiarity examined in this study.},

              1986) is used to simulate results from the infant word recognition
              literature, to provide a unified, theoretical framework for interpreting
              these findings. In a first set of simulations, we demonstrate how TRACE
              can reconcile apparently conflicting findings suggesting, on the one
              hand, that consonants play a pre-eminent role in lexical acquisition
              (Nespor, Pe\~{n}a \& Mehler, 2003; Nazzi, 2005), and on the other, that
              there is a symmetry in infant sensitivity to vowel and consonant
              mispronunciations of familiar words (Mani \& Plunkett, 2007). In a
              second series of simulations, we use TRACE to simulate infants' graded
              sensitivity to mispronunciations of familiar words as reported by White
              and Morgan (2008). An unexpected outcome is that TRACE fails to
              demonstrate graded sensitivity for White and Morgan's stimuli unless the
              inhibitory parameters in TRACE are substantially reduced. We explore the
              ramifications of this finding for theories of lexical development.
              Finally, TRACE mimics the impact of phonological neighbourhoods on early
              word learning reported by Swingley and Aslin (2007). TRACE offers an
              alternative explanation of these findings in terms of mispronunciations
              of lexical items rather than imputing word learning to infants. Together
              these simulations provide an evaluation of Developmental (Jusczyk, 1993)
              and Familiarity (Metsala, 1999) accounts of word recognition by infants
              and young children. The findings point to a role for both theoretical
              approaches whereby vocabulary structure and content constrain infant
              word recognition in an experience-dependent fashion, and highlight the
              continuity in the processes and representations involved in lexical
              development during the second year of life.},

abstract = {We used eye-tracking to investigate lexical processing in aphasic participants by examining the fixation time course for rhyme (e.g., carrot-. parrot) and cohort (e.g., beaker-. beetle) competitors. Broca's aphasic participants exhibited larger rhyme competition effects than age-matched controls. A re-analysis of previously reported data (Yee, Blumstein, {\&} Sedivy, 2008) confirmed that Wernicke's aphasic participants exhibited larger cohort competition effects. Individual-level analyses revealed a negative correlation between rhyme and cohort competition effect size across both groups of aphasic participants. Computational model simulations were performed to examine which of several accounts of lexical processing deficits in aphasia might account for the observed effects. Simulation results revealed that slower deactivation of lexical competitors could account for increased cohort competition in Wernicke's aphasic participants; auditory perceptual impairment could account for increased rhyme competition in Broca's aphasic participants; and a perturbation of a parameter controlling selection among competing alternatives could account for both patterns, as well as the correlation between the effects. In light of these simulation results, we discuss theoretical accounts that have the potential to explain the dynamics of spoken word recognition in aphasia and the possible roles of anterior and posterior brain regions in lexical processing and cognitive control. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

@article {TRACE,
abstract = {We describe a model called the TRACE model of speech perception. The model is based on the principles of interactive activation. Information processing takes place through the excitatory and inhibitory interactions of a large number of simple processing units, each working continuously to update its own activation on the basis of the activations of other units to which it is connected. The model is called the TRACE model because the network of units forms a dynamic pro- cessing structure called “the Trace,” which serves at once as the perceptual processing mechanism and as the system's working memory. The model is in- stantiated in two simulation programs. TRACE 1. described in detail elsewhere. deals with short segments of real speech, and suggests a mechanism for coping with the fact that the cues to the identity of phonemes vary as a function of context. TRACE II, the focus of this article, simulates a large number of empirical findings on the perception of phonemes and words and on the interactions of phoneme and word perception. At the phoneme level, TRACE II simulates the influence of lexical information on the identification of phonemes and accounts for the fact that lexical effects are found under certain conditions but not others. The model also shows how knowledge of phonological constraints can be em- bodied in particular lexical items but can still be used to influence processing of novel, nonword utterances. The model also exhibits categorical perception and The the ability to trade cues off against each other in phoneme identification. At the word level, the model captures the major positive feature of Marslen-Wilson's COHORT model of speech perception, in that it shows immediate sensitivity to information favoring one word or set of words over others. At the same time, it overcomes a difftculty with the COHORT model: it can recover from underspec- itication or mispronunciation of a word's beginning. TRACE II also uses lexical information to segment a stream of speech into a sequence of words and to find word beginnings and endings, and it simulates a number of recent findings related to these points. The TRACE model has some limitations, but we believe it is a step toward a psychologically and computationally adequate model of the process of speech perception.},

abstract = {Approaches to spoken word recognition differ in the importance they assign to word onsets during lexical access. This research contrasted the hypothesis that lexical access is strongly directional with the hypothesis that word onsets are less important than the overall goodness of fit between input and lexical form. A cross-modal priming technique was used to investigate the extent to which a rhyme prime (a prime that differs only in its first segment from the word that is semantically associated with the visual probe) is as effective a prime as the original word itself. Earlier research had shown that partial primes that matched from word onset were very effective cross-modal primes. The present results show that, irrespective of whether the rhyme prime was a real word or not, and irrespective of the amount of overlap between the rhyme prime and the original word, the rhymes are much less effective primes than the full word. In fact, no overall priming effect could be detected at all except under conditions in which the competitor environment was very sparse. This suggests that word onsets do have a special status in the lexical access of spoken words.},

              looked at visual displays while hearing sentences. Sentences each
              contained a target word labeling one of the two displayed pictures.
              Children's latency to fixate the labeled picture was measured.
              Children's responses were delayed when the competing distractor
              picture's label overlapped phonetically with the target at onset
              (dog-doll), but not when the pictures' labels rhymed (ball-doll),
              showing that children monitored the speech stream incrementally for
              acoustic-phonetic information specifying the correct picture. In
              Experiment 3, adults' responses in the same task were found to be very
              similar to those of the 24-month-olds. This research shows that by 24
              months, children can interpret speech continuously.},

              familiar spoken words, presented both as whole words in intact form and
              as partial words in which only the first 300 ms of the word was heard.
              In Experiment 1, 21-month-old infants (N = 32) recognized partial words
              as quickly and reliably as they recognized whole words; in Experiment 2,

              Combining the data from both experiments, efficiency in spoken word
              recognition was examined in relation to level of lexical development.
              Infants with more than 100 words in their productive vocabulary were
              more accurate in identifying familiar words than were infants with less
              than 60 words. Grouped by response speed, infants with faster mean

              capable of incremental speech processing even before entering the
              vocabulary spurt, and that lexical growth is associated with increased
              speed and efficiency in understanding spoken language.},

              during word recognition. We asked whether 18--24 month-olds (n=29)
              used coarticulatory cues on the word "the" when recognizing the
              following noun. We performed a looking-while-listening eyetracking

@article{Lew-Williams2007,
abstract = {All nouns in Spanish have grammatical gender, with obligatory gender marking on preceding articles (e.g., la and el, the feminine and masculine forms of "the," respectively). Adult native speakers of languages with grammatical gender exploit this cue in on-line sentence interpretation. In a study investigating the early development of this ability, Spanish-learning children (34-42 months) were tested in an eye-tracking procedure. Presented with pairs of pictures with names of either the same grammatical gender (la pelota, "ball [feminine]"; la galleta, "cookie [feminine]") or different grammatical gender (la pelota; el zapato, "shoe [masculine]"), they heard sentences referring to one picture (Encuentra la pelota, "Find the ball"). The children were faster to orient to the referent on different-gender trials, when the article was potentially informative, than on same-gender trials, when it was not, and this ability was correlated with productive measures of lexical and grammatical competence. Spanish-learning children who can speak only 500 words already use gender-marked articles in establishing reference, a processing advantage characteristic of native Spanish-speaking adults.},

@article{McMurray2012,
abstract = {Classic approaches to word learning emphasize referential ambiguity: In naming situations, a novel word could refer to many possible objects, properties, actions, and so forth. To solve this, researchers have posited constraints, and inference strategies, but assume that determining the referent of a novel word is isomorphic to learning. We present an alternative in which referent selection is an online process and independent of long-term learning. We illustrate this theoretical approach with a dynamic associative model in which referent selection emerges from real-time competition between referents and learning is associative (Hebbian). This model accounts for a range of findings including the differences in expressive and receptive vocabulary, cross-situational learning under high degrees of ambiguity, accelerating (vocabulary explosion) and decelerating (power law) learning, fast mapping by mutual exclusivity (and differences in bilinguals), improvements in familiar word recognition with development, and correlations between speed of processing and learning. Together it suggests that (a) association learning buttressed by dynamic competition can account for much of the literature; (b) familiar word recognition is subserved by the same processes that identify the referents of novel words (fast mapping); (c) online competition may allow the children to leverage information available in the task to augment performance despite slow learning; (d) in complex systems, associative learning is highly multifaceted; and (e) learning and referent selection, though logically distinct, can be subtly related. It suggests more sophisticated ways of describing the interaction between situation- and developmental-time processes and points to the need for considering such interactions as a primary determinant of development.

We presented 18-month-old infants with a picture-based phonological priming task and examined their recognition of named targets in primed (e.g., dog-door) and unrelated (e.g., dog-boat) trials. Infants showed better recognition of the target object in primed than in unrelated trials across three measures. As the prime image was never explicitly named during the experiment, the only explanation for the systematic influence of the prime image on target recognition is that infants, like adults, can implicitly name visually fixated images and that these implicitly generated names can prime infants' subsequent responses in a paired visual-object spoken-word-recognition task.},

Work with adults suggests that, by 5-years of age, hearing a word leads to cascaded activation of other phonologically, semantically and phono-semantically related words (Huang {\&} Snedeker, 2010; Marslen-Wilson {\&} Zwitserlood, 1989). Given substantial differences in children's sensitivity to phonological and semantic relationships between words in the first few years of life (Arias-Trejo {\&} Plunkett, 2010; Newman, Samuelson, {\&} Gupta, 2009; Storkel {\&} Hoover, 2012), the current set of experiments investigated whether children younger than five also show such phono-semantic priming. Using a picture-priming task, Experiments 1 and 2 presented 2-year-olds with phono-semantically related prime-target pairs, where the label for the prime image is phonologically related (Experiment 1 – onset CV overlap, Experiment 2 – rhyme VC overlap) to a semantic associate of the target label. Across both experiments, toddlers recognised a word faster when this was preceded by a phono- semantically related prime relative to an unrelated prime. Overall, the results provide strong evidence that word recognition involves cascaded processing of phono-semantically related words by 2-years of age. ?},

In two experiments we test the necessity of these factors by examining the inhibition between newly learned items and familiar words immediately after learning. Participants learned a set of nonwords without meanings in active (Experiment 1) or passive (Experiment 2) exposure paradigms. After training, participants performed a visual world paradigm task to assess inhibition from these newly learned items. An analysis of participants' fixations suggested that the newly learned words were able to engage in competition with known words without any consolidation.},

              native language speech perception skills show improvement,

abstract = {This is a hands-on introduction to Generalised Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs) in the context of linguistics with a particular focus on dynamic speech analysis (e.g. formant contours, pitch tracks, diachronic change, etc.). The main goal is to explain some of the main ideas underlying GAMMs, and to provide a practical guide to frequentist significance testing using these models. The introduction covers a range of topics including basis functions, the smoothing penalty, random smooths, difference smooths, smooth interactions, model comparison and autocorrelation. It is divided into two parts. The first part looks at what GAMMs are, how they work and why/when we should use them. Although the reader can replicate some of the example analyses in this section, this is not essential. The second part is a tutorial introduction that illustrates the process of fitting and evaluating GAMMs in the R statistical software environment, and the reader is strongly encouraged to work through the examples on their own machine.},

              Parental vocabulary report was used to calculate semantic density
              in several early-acquired semantic categories. Performance on two
              language-processing tasks (lexical recognition and sentence
              processing) was compared as a function of semantic density. In
              both tasks, real-time comprehension was facilitated for higher

              interference. The ﬁndings indicate that language-processing

              vocabulary that are semantically related to other known words,
              though it is not clear why this pattern emerges. In this paper,
              we explore whether infants leverage their existing vocabulary
              and semantic knowledge when interpreting novel label-object
              mappings in real time. We initially identified categorical
              domains for which individual 24-month-old infants have relatively
              higher and lower levels of knowledge, irrespective of overall
              vocabulary size. Next, we taught infants novel words in these
              higher and lower knowledge domains and then asked if their
              subsequent real-time recognition of these items varied as a
              function of their category knowledge. While our participants
              successfully acquired the novel label-object mappings in our
              task, there were important differences in the way infants
              recognized these words in real time. Namely, infants showed more
              robust recognition of high (vs. low) domain knowledge words.
              These findings suggest that dense semantic structure facilitates
              early word learning and real-time novel word recognition.},

              However, little is known about this relationship with predictive
              sentence processing in children or adults. We explore this
              question by comparing the degree to which an upcoming sentential
              theme is anticipated by combining information from a prior agent
              and action. 48 children, aged of 3 to 10, and 48 college-aged
              adults' eye-movements were recorded as they heard a sentence
              (e.g., The pirate hides the treasure) in which the object
              referred to one of four images that included an agent-related,
              action-related and unrelated distractor image. Pictures were
              rotated so that, across all versions of the study, each picture
              appeared in all conditions, yielding a completely balanced
              within-subjects design. Adults and children quickly made use of
              combinatory information available at the action to generate
              anticipatory looks to the target object. Speed of anticipatory
              fixations did not vary with age. When controlling for age,
              individuals with higher vocabularies were faster to look to the
              target than those with lower vocabulary scores. Together, these
              results support and extend current views of incremental
              processing in which adults and children make use of linguistic
              information to continuously update their mental representation
              of ongoing language.},

We investigated word-word associations in early lexical development using an adaptation of the inter-modal preferential looking task where word pairs (as opposed to single target words) were used to direct infants' attention towards a target picture. Two words (prime and target) were presented in quick succession after which infants were presented with a picture pair (target and distracter). Prime-target word pairs were either semantically and associatively related or unrelated; the targets were either named or unnamed. Experiment 1 demonstrated a lexical-semantic priming effect for 21-month olds but not for 18-month olds: unrelated prime words interfered with linguistic target identification for 21-month olds. Follow-up experiments confirmed the interfering effects of unrelated prime words and identified the existence of repetition priming effects as young as 18 months of age. The results of these experiments indicate that infants have begun to develop semantic-associative links between lexical items as early as 21 months of age.},

abstract = {A problem that tends to be ignored in the statistical analysis of experimental data in the language sciences is that responses often constitute time series, which raises the problem of autocorrelated errors. If the errors indeed show autocorrelational structure, evaluation of the significance of predictors in the model becomes problematic due to potential anti-conservatism of p-values. This paper illustrates two tools offered by Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs) (Lin and Zhang, 1999; Wood, 2006, 2011, 2013) for dealing with autocorrelated errors, as implemented in the current version of the fourth author's mgcv package (1.8.9): the possibility to specify an ar(1) error model for Gaussian models, and the possibility of using factor smooths for random-effect factors such as subject and item. These factor smooths are set up to have the same smoothing parameters, and are penalized to yield the non-linear equivalent of random intercepts and random slopes in the classical linear framework. Three case studies illustrate these issues.},

The majority of studies on children's referent selection focus on manipulating the sources of information (linguistic, contextual and pragmatic) that children can use to solve the referent mapping problem. Here, we take a step back and explore how children's endogenous biases towards novelty and their own familiarity with novel objects influence their performance in such a task. We familiarized 2-year-old children with previously novel objects. Then, on novel name referent selection trials children were asked to select the referent from three novel objects: two previously seen and one completely novel object. Children demonstrated a clear bias to select the most novel object. A second experiment controls for pragmatic responding and replicates this finding. We conclude, therefore, that children's referent selection is biased by previous exposure and children's endogenous bias to novelty.},

Using online processing measures with 18-, 24-, and 30-month-olds, we investigate how the development of this bias relates to word learning. Children's proportion of looking time to a novel object after hearing a novel name related to their success in retention of the novel word, and also to their vocabulary size. However, skill in disambiguation and retention of novel words developed gradually: 18-month-olds did not show a reliable preference for the novel object after labeling; 24-month-olds reliably looked at a novel object on Disambiguation trials but showed no evidence of retention; and 30-month-olds succeeded on Disambiguation trials and showed only fragile evidence of retention. We conclude that the ability to find the referent of a novel word in ambiguous contexts is a skill that improves from 18 to 30months of age. Word learning is characterized as an incremental process that is related to - but not dependent on - the emergence of disambiguation biases.},

abstract = {While the specificity of infants' early lexical representations has been studied extensively, researchers have only recently begun to investigate how words are organized in the developing lexicon and what mental representations are activated during processing of a word. Integrating these two lines of research, the current study asks how specific the phonological match between a perceived word and its stored form has to be in order to lead to (cascaded) lexical activation of related words during infant lexical processing. We presented German 24-month-olds with a cross-modal semantic priming task where the prime word was either correctly or incorrectly pronounced. Results indicate that correct pronunciations and mispronunciations both elicit similar semantic priming effects, suggesting that the infant word recognition system is flexible enough to handle deviations from the correct form. This might be an important prerequisite to children's ability to cope with imperfect input and to recognize words under more challenging circumstances.},

However, the order and manner in which this information is extracted remains unresolved. In two experiments, we adapted the adult four-picture Visual World Paradigm (VWP) (Huettig {\&} McQueen, 2007) for toddler testing: toddlers hear a spoken word and see pictures that are phonologically-related, semantically-related or unrelated to the spoken-word. We demonstrate that, similar to adults, 24- to 30-month-old toddlers attended to a phonological match faster than a semantic match, and that these differences hold irrespective of whether the semantic match is taxonomic or thematic in character. Our findings suggest that language shapes toddlers' cognition by biasing their selective attention to relevant information in the visual world, which is likely to enhance the efficiency of mental activities, such as learning and making analogical inferences.},

abstract = {What mechanism implements the mutual exclusivity bias to map novel labels to objects without names? Prominent theoretical accounts of mutual exclusivity (e.g., Markman, 1989, 1990) propose that infants are guided by their knowledge of object names. However, the mutual exclusivity constraint could be implemented via monitoring of object novelty (see Merriman, Marazita, {\&} Jarvis, 1995). We sought to discriminate between these contrasting explanations across two preferential looking experiments with 22-month-olds. In Experiment 1, infants viewed three objects: one name-known, two name-unknown. Of the two name-unknown objects, one was novel, and the other had been previously familiarized. The infants responded to hearing a novel label by increasing attention only to the novel, name-unknown object. In a second experiment in which the name-known object was absent, a novel label increased infants' attention to a novel object beyond baseline preference for novelty. The experiments provide clear evidence for a novelty-based mechanism. However, differences in the time course of disambiguation across experiments suggest that novelty processing may be influenced by contextual factors.},

In Study 1, we assessed the ability of 32 children between the ages of 16 and 20 months to use the N3C principle (operationally defined as the ability to fast map). As predicted, only some of the children could fast map. This finding provided evidence for a crucial tenet of the developmental lexical principles framewor: Some lexical principles are not available at the start of language acquisition. Children who had acquired the N3C principle also had significantly larger vocabularies and were significantly more likely to demonstrate 2-category exhaustive sorting abilities than children who had not acquired the principle. The 2 groups of children did not differ in either age or object permanence abilities. The 16 children who could not fast map were followed longitudinally until they attained a vocabulary spurt; at that time, their ability to fast map was retested (Study 2). Results provided a longitudinal replication of the findings of Study 1. Implications of these findings for both the developmental lexical principles framework and the specificity hypothesis are discussed.}

Thus, lexical competition--inhibitory interaction among words in speech comprehension--can prevent children from using their full phonological sensitivity in judging words as novel. These results suggest that word learning in young children, as in adults, relies not only on the discrimination and identification of phonetic categories, but also on evaluating the likelihood that an utterance conveys a new word.},

@article{Leach2007,
abstract = {People know thousands of words in their native language, and each of these words must be learned at some time in the person's lifetime. A large number of these words will be learned when the person is an adult, reflecting the fact that the mental lexicon is continuously changing. We explore how new words get added to the mental lexicon, and provide empirical support for a theoretical distinction between what we call lexical configuration and lexical engagement. Lexical configuration is the set of factual knowledge associated with a word (e.g., the word's sound, spelling, meaning, or syntactic role). Almost all previous research on word learning has focused on this aspect. However, it is also critical to understand the process by which a word becomes capable of lexical engagement-the ways in which a lexical entry dynamically interacts with other lexical entries, and with sublexical representations. For example, lexical entries compete with each other during word recognition (inhibition within the lexical level), and they also support the activation of their constituents (top-down lexical-phonemic facilitation, and lexically-based perceptual learning). We systematically vary the learning conditions for new words, and use separate measures of lexical configuration and engagement. Several surprising dissociations in behavior demonstrate the importance of the theoretical distinction between configuration and engagement. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},
