              popular method for comparing the adequacy of multiple, possibly
              nonnested models. Current practice in cognitive psychology is to
              accept a single model on the basis of only the ``raw'' AIC
              values, making it difficult to unambiguously interpret the
              observed AIC differences in terms of a continuous measure such
              as probability. Here we demonstrate that AIC values can be
              easily transformed to so-called Akaike weights (e.g., Akaike,
              1978, 1979; Bozdogan, 1987; Burnham {\&} Anderson, 2002), which
              can be directly interpreted as conditional probabilities for each
              model. We show by example how these Akaike weights can greatly
              facilitate the interpretation of the results of AIC model
              comparison procedures.},

              cross-linguistic study of word-initial lingual obstruents examined some
              effects of language-specific frequencies on consonant mastery.
              Repetitions of real words were elicited from 2- and 3-year-old children
              who were monolingual speakers of English, Cantonese, Greek, or Japanese.

              effects in phonological acquisition and for language-specific influences
              related to phoneme and phoneme sequence frequency. These results suggest
              that acquisition patterns that are common across languages arise in two
              ways. One influence is direct, via the universal constraints imposed by
              the physiology and physics of speech production and perception, and how
              these predict which contrasts will be easy and which will be difficult
              for the child to learn to control. The other influence is indirect, via
              the way universal principles of ease of perception and production tend
              to influence the lexicons of many languages through commonly attested

              at 24–31 months continued to have weaker language and reading skills at
              17 years of age than typically developing peers. Method: Language and
              reading outcomes at 17 years of age were examined in 26 children
              identified as late talkers with normal nonverbal ability and normal
              receptive language at intake and in 23 typically developing children
              matched at intake on age, socioeconomic status (SES), and nonverbal
              ability. Results: Although late talkers performed in the average range
              on all language and reading tasks at 17 years of age, they obtained
              significantly lower Vocabulary/ Grammar and Verbal Memory factor scores
              than SES-matched peers. The age 17 Vocabulary/Grammar factor had large
              correlations with the age 17 Verbal Memory and Reading/Writing factors.
              The age 17 Vocabulary/Grammar and Reading/Writing factors were strongly
              predicted by comparable factors at 13 years of age. Age 2 Language
              Development Survey ( L. Rescorla, 1989) vocabulary score explained
              17{\%} of the variance in the age 17 Vocabulary/Grammar and Verbal
              Memory factors. Conclusions: Results suggest that slow language
              development at 24–31 months is associated with a weakness in
              language-related skills into adolescence relative to skills manifested
              by typically developing peers—findings that are consistent with a

              low-income children hear relative to their more-affluent peers is often

              about this disparity by reporting the relative contributions of the

              fluent and connected communication) at 24 months, which accounted for
              27{\%} of the variance in expressive language 1 year later. These

               argued that the relation between amount of parent speech and vocabulary

               Experiment 1 established the shortest lag with which information in the
               speech signal influences eye-movement control, using stimuli such as
               "The \ldots ladder is the target". With a neutral token of the definite
               article preceding the target word, saccades to the referent were not
               more likely than saccades to an unrelated distractor until 200-240 ms
               after the onset of the target word. In Experiment 2, utterances
               contained definite articles which contained natural anticipatory
               coarticulation pertaining to the onset of the target word ("The ladder
               \ldots is the target"). A simple Gaussian classifier was able to predict
               the initial sound of the upcoming target word from formant information
               from the first few pitch periods of the article's vowel. With these

               science is lack of invariance in spoken language. We take the view that
               variability due to coarticulation is systematic and beneficial. Several
               recent eye tracking experiments have demonstrated listeners' sensitivity
               to local coarticulatory cues between adjacent phonemes. We examined
               sensitivity to longer-range, anticipatory vowel-to-vowel coarticulation,
               which can spread across multiple syllables. Using a variant of the
               Visual World eye tracking paradigm (Tanenhaus et al., 1995), we
               conducted the first on-line test of whether lexical access is sensitive
               to such subtle, long-range cues, and whether the impact of such cues is
               modulated by the coarticulation resistance of intervening segments.
               Lexical access was delayed when misleading anticipatory coarticulation
               was available in cross-spliced materials. This significantly extends the
               nature and temporal range of subcategorical cues known to influence
               on-line sentence comprehension, and demonstrates that lexical access is
               simultaneously constrained by information at multiple temporal grains.},

              of the many available segmentation cues is foolproof. So, we used the

              multiple cues. We also explored whether infants find speech cues
              produced by coarticulation useful in word segmentation. Using natural
              speech syllables, we replicated Saffran, Aslin, et al.'s (1996) study

              speech based on statistical cues alone. Next, we added conflicting
              segmentation cues. Experiment 2 pitted stress against statistics,
              whereas Experiment 3 pitted coarticulation against statistics. In both

              language acquisition. This research has yielded some seemingly
              contradictory findings: In some studies infants appear to use phonetic
              and indexical detail that they fail to use in other studies. In this
              article we present a new, unified framework for accounting for these
              divergent findings. PRIMIR (a developmental framework for Processing
              Rich Information from Multidimensional Interactive Representations)
              assumes there is rich information available in the speech input and that
              the child picks up and organizes this information along a number of
              multidimensional interactive planes. Use of this rich information
              depends on the joint activity of 3 dynamic filters. These filters-the
              initial biases, the developmental level of the child, and requirements
              of the specific language task the child is facing-work together to
              differentially direct attention to 1 (or more) plane. In this article we
              outline the contradictory data that need to be explained, elucidate
              PRIMIR, including its underlying assumptions and overall architecture,

              Word-learning tasks suggest that young infants (14 months old) confuse
              similar-sounding words, whereas mispronunciation detection tasks suggest
              that slightly older infants (18–24 months old) correctly distinguish
              similar words. Here we explore whether the difficulty at 14 months stems
              from infants' novice status as word learners or whether it is inherent
              in the task demands of learning new words. Results from 3 experiments
              support a developmental explanation. In Experiment 1, infants of 20
              months learned to pair 2 phonetically similar words to 2 different
              objects under precisely the same conditions that infants of 14 months
              (Experiment 2) failed. In Experiment 3, infants of 17 months showed
              intermediate, but still successful, performance in the task. Vocabulary
              size predicted word-learning performance, but only in the younger, less
              experienced word learners. The implications of these results for
              theories of word learning and lexical representation are discussed.},

              1986) is used to simulate results from the infant word recognition
              literature, to provide a unified, theoretical framework for interpreting
              these findings. In a first set of simulations, we demonstrate how TRACE
              can reconcile apparently conflicting findings suggesting, on the one
              hand, that consonants play a pre-eminent role in lexical acquisition
              (Nespor, Pe\~{n}a \& Mehler, 2003; Nazzi, 2005), and on the other, that
              there is a symmetry in infant sensitivity to vowel and consonant
              mispronunciations of familiar words (Mani \& Plunkett, 2007). In a
              second series of simulations, we use TRACE to simulate infants' graded
              sensitivity to mispronunciations of familiar words as reported by White
              and Morgan (2008). An unexpected outcome is that TRACE fails to
              demonstrate graded sensitivity for White and Morgan's stimuli unless the
              inhibitory parameters in TRACE are substantially reduced. We explore the
              ramifications of this finding for theories of lexical development.
              Finally, TRACE mimics the impact of phonological neighbourhoods on early
              word learning reported by Swingley and Aslin (2007). TRACE offers an
              alternative explanation of these findings in terms of mispronunciations
              of lexical items rather than imputing word learning to infants. Together
              these simulations provide an evaluation of Developmental (Jusczyk, 1993)
              and Familiarity (Metsala, 1999) accounts of word recognition by infants
              and young children. The findings point to a role for both theoretical
              approaches whereby vocabulary structure and content constrain infant
              word recognition in an experience-dependent fashion, and highlight the
              continuity in the processes and representations involved in lexical
              development during the second year of life.},

              evidence indicates that word segmentation is promoted by both lexical
              (knowledge-derived) and sublexical (signal-derived) cues. However, an
              account of how these cues operate in combination or in conflict is
              lacking. The present study fills this gap by assessing speech
              segmentation when cues are systematically pitted against each other. The
              results demonstrate that listeners do not assign the same power to all
              segmentation cues; rather, cues are hierarchically integrated, with
              descending weights allocated to lexical, segmental, and prosodic cues.
              Lower level cues drive segmentation when the interpretive conditions are
              altered by a lack of contextual and lexical information or by white
              noise. Taken together, the results call for an integrated, hierarchical,
